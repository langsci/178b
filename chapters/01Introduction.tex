\section{Aims of the study}\label{IntroAims}

The goal of this study is twofold.
First,
I will investigate the relationships between information structure and linguistic forms in spoken Japanese.
Second,
I propose a method to investigate the relations between information structure and linguistic forms in any language using corpora.

Speakers of Japanese, like speakers of many other languages,
infer the knowledge of other people and
express their assumption about it using various linguistic and non-linguistic ways.
Consider a piece of conversation of three people, A, B, and C
from \ci{the Chiba three-party conversation corpus} \cite{Den_2007_SAC}.
In \Next[-A1],
one of the participant, A, starts talking about \ci{ano koohii-meekaa} `that coffee machine'.
B in B2 to B4 explains why A started to talk about it;
it is related to the previous topic (too many people gathered in a small room).
C just adds weak backchannel response in C5.
In A6--A7,
A asks C whether she knows the new coffee machine that arrived in building E.
In C8--C11,
C answers to A that
C knows about it but has never tried it.%

	Some of the utterances were omitted for the sake of simplicity.

From this short conversation,
observers (namely, we) can infer that
A in A1 assumed that the other participants already know about the great coffee machine that was introduced in their lab.
One can also infer that B in B2--B4 already knows about the coffee machine.
In A6--A7,
A appears to think that C might not know about the coffee machine.
However, C in C8 explicitly denies that A's concern does not apply.

Why is it possible for us to infer the assumption of speakers about the knowledge of other participants'?
In this case, linguistic expressions such as
\ci{ano (koohii meekaa)} `that (coffee machine)' in A1 and
\ci{sit-teru:} `(do you) know...?' in A6
indicate A's assumption about the other participants' knowledge.

This thesis investigates more subtle linguistic expression in spoken Japanese:
particles, word order, and intonation.
Let us discuss
the distinction between the particles \ci{ga} and \ci{wa},
that has been discussed for a long time in the literature of Japanese linguistics.
Examples \Next[a] with the particle \ci{ga} and \Next[b] with \ci{wa}
express the same proposition `A/the dog is running',
where definiteness is not explicit in the original Japanese sentences.
The expression \ci{inu} `dog' followed by \ci{ga} in \Next[a]
can be interpreted to be either definite or indefinite,
while that followed by \ci{wa} in \Next[b]
can only be interpreted to be definite;
from \Next[b] we can infer that the speaker assumes the hearer already knows about the dog.
%
\ex.
 \ag. inu-\EM{ga} hasit-teiru \\
      dog-\ab{nom} run-\ab{prog} \\
      `A/the dog is running.'
 \bg. inu-\EM{wa} hasit-teiru \\
      dog-\ab{top} run-\ab{prog} \\
      `The dog is running.'
 \hfill{(Constructed)}

As will be discussed in Chapter \ref{Particles},
however,
it is not the case that
the NP coded by \ci{wa} is always definite,
nor is it the case that
the NP coded by \ci{ga} is always indefinite.
What determines the usage of the particles?
Moreover,
the choice of particles interacts with other factors such as
word order and intonation.
This thesis investigates how information structure affects
the choices of particles, word order, and intonation
employing a corpus of spoken Japanese.

\section{Background}\label{IntroBackground}

Information structure in this thesis comprises
``the utterance-internal structural and semantic properties reflecting the relation of an utterance to the discourse context,
in terms of the discourse status of its content,
the actual and attributed attentional status of the discourse participants,
and the participants' prior and changing attitudes
(knowledge, beliefs, intentions, expectations, etc.)''
\cite[250]{kruijff-korbayovasteedman03}.
I assume that
information structure is subordinate part of discourse structure,
which is a clause-level unit and does not allow recursivity.
Also, I suppose that information structure should be analyzed at the surface level rather than at the level of underlying semantics (or logical form).

There are two kinds of roots of studies on information structure
(see \citeA{kruijff-korbayovasteedman03} for a useful survey).
One started from studies on definite and indefinite descriptions by \citeA{russell05} and \citeA{strawson50,strawson64}.
These studies triggered the discussion on presupposition and assertion,
which has been at issue until the present time.
Especially, they have influenced contemporary scholars of logics, formal semantics, and generative grammar \cite{chomsky65,jackendoff72,selkirk84,rooth85,rizzi97,erteschik-shir97,erteschik-shir07,buring07,ishihara11,krifkamusan12,endo14}.
The other started from studies of Prague School \cite{mathesius28,mathesius29,sgall67,firbas75}.
Their studies have especially inspired functional linguistics
\cite{bolinger65,halliday67,kuno73,gundel74,chafe76,chafe94,prince81,givon83,tomlin86,lambrecht94,birnerward98,birnerward09}.
Some scholars were influenced by both of these traditions
\cite{vallduvi90,steedman91,vallduvivilkuna98}.
Almost independent of this tradition of European and American linguistics,
the so-called topic particle \ci{wa} in Japanese,
often as opposed to the case particle \ci{ga},
has gathered attention of Japanese linguists for a long time \cite{matsushita28,yamada36,tokieda50,mikami53,mikami60,onoe81,kinsui95,kikuchi95,noda96,masuoka00,masuoka12}.
In addition to the issue of the usage of \ci{wa},
the discussion on \ci{wa} also elicited the question of the nature of subject
because, on the surface, \ci{wa} frequently alternates with \ci{ga},
the so-called subject particle.
See Chapter \ref{Background} for detail.

More recently,
more studies investigate actual productions and understandings of language instead of acceptability judgements of constructed examples.
Corpus-oriented studies  
\cite[e.g.,][]{calhounetal05,gotzeetal07,chiarcosetal11}
inherit both of the traditions of information structure:
the logic and the functional traditions.
Other corpus-oriented studies such as \citeA{hajicovaetal00},
annotating Czech, are based on the Prague School theory.
There are also questionnaires for eliciting expressions related to information structure cross-linguistically \cite{skopeteasetal06}.
\citeA{cowles03} and \citeA{cowlesferreira12} investigate information structure mainly employing psycholinguistic experiments.

I am influenced most by the tradition of functional linguistics and corpus linguistics.
Although I tried to include knowledge from studies of other traditions as much as possible,
sometimes my assumptions might be difficult to understand for readers of other traditions.
I assume that usage shapes a language \cite{givon76,comrie83,comrie89,bybeehopper01} and
am interested in how linguistic usage affects the shape of a language.
In this thesis,
I focus on the question of how the usage related to information structure affects linguistic form in Japanese.


%%----------------------------------------------------
\section{Methodology}\label{IntroMethodology}

I investigate linguistic forms in spoken Japanese associated with
information structure
mainly by examining spoken corpora.
It is well known that information structure phenomena are so subtle
that slight change in contexts can affect the judgement of the sentence in question;
acceptability judgements from a single person (i.e., the author) are not reliable.
This is the reason why I employ spoken corpora;
the speakers produce utterances naturally without concentrating on information structure too much like linguists.
Moreover, contexts are available in spoken corpora,
which are crucial for observers to determine the information structure of a sentence.
%Corpus investigation is a scientific method to investigate language
%because everybody can test the result using the same methodology.
It is also well known, however,
that information structure annotation is very hard.
There are studies on annotating information structure in various corpora in different languages
\cite{hajicovaetal00,calhounetal05,gotzeetal07,ritzetal08,chiarcosetal11}.
Some use syntactic information to decide the information structure of a sentence \cite{hajicovaetal00};
some use intonation \cite{calhounetal05};
others use linguistic tests \cite{gotzeetal07,chiarcosetal11}.
But many of the studies employ multiple features to decide the information structure of a sentence.
For example,
\citeA{gotzeetal07},
in annotating ``aboutness topic'',
not only employ tests such as whether the NP in question can be the answer to the question ``let me tell you something about X'',
but also employs morphological information of the NP
such as referentiality, definiteness, genericity, etc.
In the present work, I annotate multiple features of ``topichood'' and ``focushood'',
rather than annotating homogeneous ``topic'' and ``focus''.
I consider a topic as a cluster of features of presupposed, evoked, definite, specific, animate, etc.,
and a focus as a cluster of features of asserted, brand-new, indefinite, non-specific, inanimate, etc.
I assume that they typically (frequently) have these features.
Not all the features are necessarily present in topics or foci;
there could be infrequent (i.e., atypical) topics which are indefinite or inanimate,
or there could be foci which are definite or animate.
See discussion in Chapter \ref{Framework} for detail.

I sometimes employ acceptability judgements and production experiment
to support my argument.
I believe that, in the future,
it is necessary to test all the hypotheses by multiple methods
for a scientific investigation of language.

\section{Overview}\label{IntroOverview}

I outline chapters of this thesis.
In Chapter \ref{Background},
I provide an overview of the previous studies on information structure in across languages.
I also describe basic features of Japanese and review studies on Japanese related to this thesis.
In Chapter \ref{Framework},
I outline the framework employed in the thesis;
the notions of topic, focus, and related features to them.
Moreover, I introduce the nature of the corpora,
the annotation procedure, and the methods to analyze the results.
The following three chapters analyze linguistic forms in spoken Japanese
in the framework of this thesis.
Chapter \ref{Particles} investigates particles,
Chapter \ref{WordOrder} analyzes word order, and
Chapter \ref{Intonation} inquires intonation.
In Chapter \ref{Discussion},
I summarize the thesis and discuss theoretical aspects of the thesis.
