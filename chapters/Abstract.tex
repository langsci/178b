This book investigates the association between \isi{information structure}
and linguistic forms in spoken Japanese
mainly by analyzing spoken corpora.
It proposes multi-dimensional annotation and analysis procedures for spoken corpora and
explores the relationship between \isi{information structure}
and particles, \isi{word order}, and intonation.

Particles, \isi{word order}, and intonation in spoken Japanese have been investigated separately using different frameworks and different subfields in the literature
but there is no unified theory to account for all the phenomena.
This book investigated the phenomena as a whole in a consistent way
by annotating all target expressions according to the same criteria and
by employing the same analytical framework.
Chapter \ref{Introduction} outlines the questions to be investigated and introduces the methodology of this book.
Chapter \ref{Background} reviews the Japanese linguistics literature
as well as the literature on \isi{information structure} in different languages.
Chapter \ref{Framework} proposes the analytical framework of the book.
Major findings are discussed in Chapter \ref{Particles}, \ref{WordOrder}, and \ref{Intonation}.

Chapter \ref{Particles} analyzes the distributions of \isi{topic} and case particles.
It is made clear that so-called \isi{topic} particles 
(\ci{wa}, the zero particles, \ci{toiuno-wa}, and \ci{kedo/ga} preceded by \isi{copula}) are mainly sensitive to the given-new taxonomy,
whereas case particles (\ci{ga}, \ci{o}, and the zero particles) are sensitive to both focushood and grammatical function.
While the distinction between \ci{wa} and \ci{ga} attract much attention in traditional Japanese linguistics,
the distribution of different kinds of \isi{topic} and case particles, including the zero particles,
are analyzed in this book.

Chapter \ref{WordOrder} investigates \isi{word order}:
i.e., clause-initial, pre-predicate, and post-pred\-i\-cate noun phrases. %
%%%ISSUE OUT OF ALIGNMENT
Topical NPs appear either clause-initially or post-pred\-i\-cat\-ively,
while focal NPs appear pre-predicatively.
Clause-initial and post-pred\-i\-cate NPs are different mainly in status in the given-new taxonomy.
The previous literature investigated clause-initial, pre-predicate, and post-predicate constructions in different frameworks;
however, there was no unified account for \isi{word order} in Japanese.
The book outlines \isi{word order} in spoken Japanese in a unified framework.

\newpage 
Chapter \ref{Intonation} investigates intonation.
While the previous literature mainly concentrates on \isi{contrastive focus},
this book discusses both \isi{topic} and focus.
It turns out that intonation corresponds to a unit of processing and
argues that \isi{information structure} influences the form of intonation units.

Chapter \ref{Discussion} discusses the theoretical implications of these findings.
Finally, Chapter \ref{Conclusion} summarizes the book
and points out some remaining issues and possible future studies.
