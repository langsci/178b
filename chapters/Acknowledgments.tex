This work is based on my PhD thesis,
\ci{Information Structure in Spoken Japanese: Particles, Word Order, and Intonation},
submitted in 2016 to Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University.
In 2005, I started as a graduate student of linguistics in Kyoto University, and more than 10 years have passed since then.
I cannot believe that I concentrated on a single topic for this long time,
and, on top of that,
I cannot believe that many people patiently and kindly
encouraged and helped me to finish the thesis.

First, I am most grateful to my advisor, Yuji Togo.
Since I started my graduate education,
he taught me a lot of important things,
suggested interesting issues related to my interest,
gave me precise advice, and
showed me how a scientist should be through his research and his lectures.
Without him,
I could not have even imagined finishing the thesis.
He encouraged me to do things that seemed impossible for me to achieve.

Also, I thank Yukinori Takubo and Koji Fujita,
who refereed my dissertation.
Their detailed questions and comments shed light on new issues of my thesis
from different perspectives.

In my early career in the graduate school in Kyoto University,
I met many professors and colleagues who shared interesting topics with me, advised my research, and showed their own exciting works:
Masa-Aki Yamanashi, Daisuke Yokomori, Yoshihiko Asao, Masanobu Masuda, Akihiro Yamazaki, Yukinori Kimoto, Chris Davis, Tomoko Endo, and many others who studied together.
I was very lucky to see them.
It is unfortunate that I can only name a few people here.
I thank all the people.

I learned a lot through investigating the same topic and wiring a paper with Yoshihiko Asao, Naonori Nagaya, and Daisuke Yokomori.
Especially, the works I did with Yoshihiko Asao and Naonori Nagaya,
triggered by lectures in LSA Summer Institute 2007 at Stanford University,
influenced my research methods and research topics.
Also, I thank Yasuharu Den and his colleagues, Katsuya Takanashi, Hanae Koiso, Mika Enomoto, Kikuo Maekawa, and many others,
who inspired me and expanded my view on linguistic research.
Also, I owe a lot to Yasuharu Den, who helped to conduct statistical analysis
throughout the thesis.
Potential problems, mistakes, and misunderstanding are due to my limited knowledge of statistics.

Chapter \ref{Particles}, especially \S \ref{CasePar}, is based on my master's thesis
submitted to State University of New York, Buffalo.
I also thank the faculty members and colleagues there.
Especially, I am grateful to Matthew Dryer,
who gave me insightful comments on my master's thesis.

Last but not least,
I am indebted to reviewers of Language Science Press,
who later revealed their identities: Yukiko Morimoto and Satoshi Imamura.
They devoted their time to giving detailed comments and questions and
helped this work to be further refined.

While I was writing my dissertation,
I was funded by Long-Term Study Abroad Program of Japan Student Services Organization,
and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (15J03835).
