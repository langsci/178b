Aims of the studyIntroAims

The goal of this study is twofold.
First,
I will investigate the relationships between information structure and linguistic forms in spoken Japanese.
Second,
I propose a method to investigate the relations between information structure and linguistic forms in any language using corpora.

Speakers of Japanese, like speakers of many other languages,
infer the knowledge of other people and
express their assumptions about it using various linguistic and non-linguistic ways.
Consider a piece of conversation of three people, A, B, and C
from the Chiba three-party conversation corpus Den_2007_SAC.
In [-A1],
one of the participants, A, starts talking about ano koohii-meekaa `that coffee machine'.
B in B2 to B4 explains why A started to talk about it;
it is related to the previous topic (too many people gathered in a small room).
C just adds weak backchannel response in C5.
In A6--A7,
A asks C whether she knows of the new coffee machine that arrived in building E.
In C8--C11,
C answers to A that
C knows about it but has never tried it.
	 
	Some of the utterances were omitted for the sake of simplicity.

 .[A1:] ano koohii-meekaa sugoi-yo-ne 

      that coffee-maker great-fp-fp 

      `That coffee machine is excellent, isn's it?'

           `almost always work in the brainwave room, so...'
          chiba0932: 172.39-191.46

















From this short conversation,
observers (namely, we) can infer that
A in A1 assumed that the other participants already know about the great coffee machine that was introduced in their lab.
One can also infer that B in B2--B4 already knows about the coffee machine.
In A6--A7,
A appears to think that C might not know about the coffee machine.
However, C in C8 explicitly denies that A's concern does not apply.

Why is it possible for us to infer the assumption of speakers about the knowledge of other participants?
In this case, linguistic expressions such as
ano (koohii meekaa) `that (coffee machine)' in A1 and
sit-teru: `(do you) know...?' in A6
indicate A's assumption about the other participants' knowledge.

This study investigates more subtle linguistic expressions than these determiners in spoken Japanese:
particles, word order, and intonation.
Let us discuss
the distinction between the particles ga and wa,
that has been discussed for a long time in the literature on Japanese linguistics.
Examples [a] with the particle ga and [b] with wa
express the same proposition `A/the dog is running',
where definiteness is not explicit in the original Japanese sentences.
The expression inu `dog' followed by ga in [a]
can be interpreted to be either definite or indefinite,
while that followed by wa in [b]
can only be interpreted to be definite;
from [b] we can infer that the speaker assumes the hearer already knows about the dog.

.
 . inu-ga hasit-teiru 

      dog-nom run-prog 

      `A/the dog is running.'
 . inu-wa hasit-teiru 

      dog-top run-prog 

      `The dog is running.'
 (Constructed)

As will be discussed in Chapter Particles,
however,
it is not the case that
the NP coded by wa is always definite,
nor is it the case that
the NP coded by ga is always indefinite.
What determines the usage of the particles?
Moreover,
the choice of particles interacts with other factors such as
word order and intonation.
This study investigates how information structure affects
the choices of particles, word order, and intonation
employing a corpus of spoken Japanese.


BackgroundIntroBackground

Information structure in this study comprises
``the utterance-internal structural and semantic properties reflecting the relation of an utterance to the discourse context,
in terms of the discourse status of its content,
the actual and attributed attentional status of the discourse participants,
and the participants' prior and changing attitudes
(knowledge, beliefs, intentions, expectations, etc.)''
[250]kruijff-korbayovasteedman03.
I assume that
information structure is a subordinate part of discourse structure,
which is a clause-level unit and does not allow recursivity.
Also, I suppose that information structure should be analyzed at the surface level rather than at the level of underlying semantics (or logical form).

There are two kinds of roots of studies on information structure
(see kruijff-korbayovasteedman03 for a useful survey).
One started from studies on definite and indefinite descriptions by russell05 and strawson50,strawson64.
These studies triggered the discussion on presupposition and assertion,
which has been at issue until the present time.
In particular, they have influenced contemporary scholars of logic, formal semantics, and generative grammar chomsky65,jackendoff72,selkirk84,rooth85,rizzi97,erteschik-shir97,erteschik-shir07,buring07,ishihara11,krifkamusan12,endo14.
The other started from studies of the Prague School mathesius28,mathesius29,sgall67,firbas75.
Their studies have especially inspired functional linguistics
bolinger65,halliday67,kuno73,gundel74,chafe76,chafe94,prince81,givon83,tomlin86,lambrecht94,birnerward98,birnerward09.
Some scholars were influenced by both of these traditions
vallduvi90,steedman91,vallduvivilkuna98.

Almost independent of this tradition of European and American linguistics,
the so-called topic particle wa in Japanese,
often as opposed to the case particle ga,
has gathered attention of Japanese linguists for a long time matsushita28,yamada36,tokieda50,mikami53,mikami60,onoe81,kinsui95,kikuchi95,noda96,masuoka00,masuoka12.
In addition to the issue of the usage of wa,
the discussion on wa also elicited the question of the nature of subject
because, on the surface, wa frequently alternates with ga,
the so-called subject particle.
See Chapter Background for details.

More recently,
more studies have investigated actual productions and understandings of language than the acceptability judgements of constructed examples.
Corpus-oriented studies  
[e.g.,][]calhounetal05,gotzeetal07,chiarcosetal11
inherit both of the traditions of information structure:
the logical and the functional traditions.
Other corpus-oriented studies such as hajicovaetal00,
annotating Czech, are based on the Prague School theory.
There are also questionnaires for eliciting expressions related to information structure cross-linguistically skopeteasetal06.
cowles03 and cowlesferreira12 investigate information structure mainly by employing psycholinguistic experiments.

I am influenced most by the tradition of functional linguistics and corpus linguistics.
Although I tried to include the work of other traditions as much as possible, sometimes readers of other traditions might have difficulty in understanding my assumptions.


I assume that usage shapes a language givon76,comrie83,comrie89,bybeehopper01 and
am interested in how linguistic usage affects the shape of a language.
In this study,
I focus on the question of how the usage related to information structure affects linguistic form in Japanese.



MethodologyIntroMethodology

I investigate linguistic forms in spoken Japanese associated with
information structure
mainly by examining spoken corpora.
It is well known that information structure phenomena are so subtle
that slight changes in contexts can affect the judgement of the sentence in question;
acceptability judgements from a single person (i.e., the author) are not reliable.
This is the reason why I employ spoken corpora;
the speakers produce utterances naturally without concentrating on information structure too much like linguists.
Moreover, contexts are available in spoken corpora,
which are crucial for observers to determine the information structure of a sentence.


It is also well known, however,
that information structure annotation is very hard.
There are studies on annotating information structure in various corpora in different languages
hajicovaetal00,calhounetal05,gotzeetal07,ritzetal08,chiarcosetal11.
Some use syntactic information to decide the information structure of a sentence hajicovaetal00;
some use intonation calhounetal05;
others use linguistic tests gotzeetal07,chiarcosetal11.
But many of the studies employ multiple features to decide the information structure of a sentence.
For example,
gotzeetal07,
in annotating ``aboutness topic'',
not only employ tests such as whether the NP in question can be the answer to the question ``let me tell you something about X'',
but also employ morphological information of the NP
such as referentiality, definiteness, genericity, etc.
In the present work, I annotate multiple features of ``topichood'' and ``focushood'',
rather than annotating homogeneous ``topic'' and ``focus''.
I consider a topic as a cluster of features of presupposed, evoked, definite, specific, animate, etc.,
and a focus as a cluster of features of asserted, brand-new, indefinite, non-specific, inanimate, etc.
I assume that they typically (frequently) have these features.
Not all the features are necessarily present in topics or foci;
there could be infrequent (i.e., atypical) topics which are indefinite or inanimate,
or there could be foci which are definite or animate.
See discussion in Chapter Framework for details.

I sometimes employ acceptability judgements and production experiments
to support my argument.
I believe that, in the future,
it will be necessary to test all the hypotheses by multiple methods
for a scientific investigation of language.



OverviewIntroOverview

I will now outline the chapters of this book.
In Chapter Background,
I provide an overview of the previous studies on information structure in across languages.
I also describe the basic features of Japanese and review studies on Japanese related to this study.
In Chapter Framework,
I outline the framework employed in the study;
the notions of topic, focus, and features related to them.
Moreover, I introduce the nature of the corpora,
the annotation procedure, and the methods to analyze the results.
The following three chapters analyze linguistic forms in spoken Japanese.
Chapter Particles investigates particles,
Chapter WordOrder analyzes word order, and
Chapter Intonation inquires into intonation.
In Chapter Discussion,
I summarize the study and discuss its theoretical aspects.


















BackgroundBackground


























Introduction

























This chapter provide an overview of various definitions of (or notions frequently associated with) topics (BackSecTopic) and foci (BackSecFocus).
In each section,
I first introduce the definition of topics and foci to be used in this study.
Then I review the literature.





Topic is roughly equivalent to ``psychological subject'' gabelentz69, ``theme'' [e.g.,][]danes70,halliday04, ``ground'', ``background'', and ``link'' vallduvi94,
although there are many (sometimes crucial) differences among these.
In the same manner,
focus is roughly equivalent to ``psychological predicate'', ``rheme'', ``foreground'', and ``comment''.
gundel74 and kruijff-korbayovasteedman03 provide a useful summary of the history of these notions.

In reviewing the literature,
I emphasize two aspects:
the importance of the definition of topics and foci proposed in the study and, at the same time,
their heterogeneous characteristics.
The present study argues that topics and foci in different languages form prototype categories with different features of different degrees.
This position is similar to firbas75 and givon76,
who viewed topic as a gradient notion,
although the proposed features are not exactly the same.
Also, I only assume a single layer of information structure
rather than assuming multiple layers such as the topic-comment vs. focus-background layers.
While many researchers hypothesize multiple layers of information structure,
I instead suppose a flat layer of information structure with multiple features.


In BackSecCharJap, finally,
I review the literature on Japanese particles, word order, and intonation.




TopicBackSecTopic

In this section, I give a brief overview of the definitions of topic.
The notion of topic is controversial, and the history is complicated.
I classify these complicated notions into several representative categories in the following subsections.
Before the overview, I first introduce the definition of topic in this study to make the discussion clear.


The definition of topic in this studyBackSubsecDefTopic











Since I assume that information structure is a cognitive notion, I define the topic from a cognitive standpoint.
The definition of topic is stated in .

. BackDefTopic Topic is a discourse element that the speaker assumes or presupposes to be shared (known or taken for granted) and uncontroversial in a given sentence both by the speaker and the hearer.

This definition follows and elaborates the idea of topics (daimoku-tai `topic form') in matsushita28,
who states that ``the theme of judgement [topic] should not be changed before the judgement'' (p. 774, translated by NN).
Also, he states that the topic is ``determinate'' (p. 775).

In terms of the given-new taxonomy proposed by prince81 shown in ,
topics defined in include unused, declining (to be discussed below), inferable, and evoked elements [4.4.2]lambrecht94.
  
 Inferable elements are further divided into containing and non-containing inferable elements, and
 evoked elements are divided into textually and situationally evoked elements.
 I omit these distinctions since they are irrelevant to the discussion.
 

By the statement that topics are ``shared'',
I mean that topics are either unused, declining, inferable, or evoked.


.Back:Top:DefTop:GNTaxonomy

 [.Assumed Familiarity [.New [.Brand-new Unanchored Anchored ] Unused ] [.Declining ] [.Inferable ] [.Evoked ] ]

[modified from][237]prince81


A new element refers to an entity the speaker first introduces into the discourse;
in other words, ``[the speaker] tells the hearer to `put it on the counter''' [235]prince81.
A brand-new element refers to a new entity that ``the hearer may have had to create'' (ibid.).
There are two types of brand-new elements: anchored and unanchored.
``A discourse entity is Anchored if the NP representing it is linked, by means of another NP, or `Anchor', properly contained in it, to some other discourse entity'' (op.cit.: 236).
According to Prince, ``a bus [...] is Unanchored, or simply Brand-New, whereas a guy I work with [...], containing the NP I, is Brand-new Anchored, as the discourse entity the hearer creates for this particular guy will be immediately linked to his/her discourse entity for the speaker'' (ibid.).
An unused element refers to an entity ``the hearer may be assumed to have a corresponding entity in his/her own model and simply has to place it in (or copy it into) the discourse-model'' (ibid.) such as Noam Chomsky.
An NP refers to an evoked entity ``if [the] NP is uttered whose entity is already in the discourse-model, or `on the counter''' (ibid.).
``A discourse entity is Inferable if the speaker assumes the hearer can infer it, via logical--or, more commonly, plausible--reasoning, from discourse entities already Evoked or from other Inferables'' (ibid.).

In addition, I put declining elements in the taxonomy.
A declining element refers to an entity which has been mentioned a while ago but is assumed to be declining in the hearer's mind because it has not been referred to for a while.
Declining elements are assumed to be in semi-active state in terms of chafe87,chafe94.
The referents of declining elements are in semi-active state especially through ``deactivation from an earlier active state'' [29]chafe87.
Chafe's concept of semi-active also includes inferable entities.
Since I want to distinguish inferable from declining,
I introduce a new term.

Note that the condition where the speaker assumes the element to be shared is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of topic;
if the element in question is a topic, a topic is assumed by the speaker to be shared with the hearer,
but it is not necessarily the case that
all shared elements are topics.
The topic element must also be assumed to be uncontroversial,
and I argue that this is a necessary and sufficient condition for topic,
(see FrameworkTopic for details).

Also note that the definition of topic in BackDefTopic includes heterogeneous elements in .

Therefore, definition BackDefTopic does not necessarily contradict the definitions proposed in the previous literature.
Rather, it includes many of the previous definitions and restates them in terms of a cognitive viewpoint.

In the following sections, I provide a brief overview of the notions of topics in the previous literature by comparing them with the notion I propose in the present study.


Aboutness

One of the representative definitions of topic is that
topic is what the sentence is about.
This definition is employed by various linguists such as matsushita28,kuno72,gundel74,reinhart81,dik78,lambrecht94, and erteschik-shir07.

Topic as things under discussion [e.g.,][]heycock08 is also classified here.
Here I will discuss reinhart81 because this is one of the most detailed and influential works.


According to reinhart81,
inspired by strawson64,
topics should be characterized in terms of aboutness.
More precisely,
``an expression will be understood as representing the topic
if the assertion is understood as intending to expand our knowledge of this topic'' [59]reinhart81.
   
  Although Reinhart's idea of the definition of topic is basically from Strawson,
  the discussion in this work is based on reinhart81.
  This is because she notes that her ``presentation of [the criteria of topics] may not be fully loyal to [Strawson's] original intentions'' since ``[Strawson's] criteria are introduced in a rather parsimonious manner'' (59).
  
Moreover, the truth value of a sentence is assessed with respect to the topic (ibid.).
She proposes some tests to identify a topic in a sentence.
The first one is an as for/regarding test;
an expression X is a topic if it is felicitously paraphrased as as for/regarding X (p. 63, see also kuno72,kuno76,gundel74).
Therefore, Matilda in [a] and your second proposal [b] are topics.

. . As for Matilda, she can't stand Felix.
     . Regarding your second proposal, the board has found it unfeasible.
     .[] [59]reinhart81

As she cautions, however,
not all topics can be identified in this way
because as for and regarding are typically used to change the current topic keenanschieffelin76,durantiochs79.
For example, as for this book in is awkward even though this is clearly a topic.
This is because the book has already been the topic of the previous sentence.

. Kracauer's book is probably the most famous ever written on the subject of the cinema.
 ??As for this book, many more people are familiar with its catchy title then[sic] are acquainted with its [turgid] text.
 [64]reinhart81

Therefore, she proposes a ``more reliable test'',
which embeds the sentence in question in about sentences.
This is exemplified in ,
where the book is correctly identified as a topic.

. He said about/of the book that many more people are familiar with its catchy title than are acquainted with its turgid text.
  (op. cit., 65)


To formalize this intuition, Reinhart introduces the notion of possible pragmatic assertions.
It is assumed that ``each declarative sentence is associated with a set of possible pragmatic assertions (PPA), which means that that sentence can be used to introduce the content of any of these assertions into the context set'' (p. 80).
The context set of a given discourse at a given point is a set of propositions that both the speaker and the hearer have accepted to be true at this point stalnaker78.
The set of PPA's of a given sentence S is defined in ,
where  indicates the proposition expressed by S.

. BackExPPA PPA =  together with [:  is the interpretation of an NP expression in S]
   [80-81]reinhart81

Assuming , the topic expression of a sentence S in a context C
is defined as in .

. BackExAboutness Topic is ``the expression corresponding to  in the pair  of PPA which is selected in C ''.
    (op. cit., 81)

This is achieved in the following steps:
(i) ``if possible, the proposition  expressed in S will be assessed by the hearer in C with respect to the subset of propositions already listed in the context set under '', and
(ii) ``if  is not rejected it will be added to the context set under the entry '' (ibid.).

Since this definition of topic in terms of aboutness is attractive and seems to coincide with our intuition,
many linguists adopt this definition [e.g.,][]lambrecht94,erteschik-shir07.
However, I do not employ this definition
although my criteria of topics in BackDefTopic and Reinhart's BackExAboutness are apparently very similar and
the elements covered by these two definitions overlap most of the time.
Given that I am interested in finding topic expressions in corpora,
aboutness is not clear enough for my purpose.
For example, vallduvi94 presents the following hypothetical mini-conversation between a newly-appointed White House butler (H) and the Foreign Office Secretary after returning from a trip to Europe (S).

. .[H:] I am arranging things for the president's dinner. Anything I should know?
     .[S:] Yes. [The president] [hates the Delft china set].

     flushright
     [9, 12]vallduvi94
     flushright

In this example, Vallduvi identifies hates the Delft china set as focus,
whereas it passes the about test as shown in .

. The Foreign Office Secretary said about the Delft china set that the president hates it.


Since I am assuming that topics are in complementary distribution with focus elements,
the element in question is not a focus if it is a topic, and vice versa.

On the other hand, the no- and aha-tests proposed in FrameworkTopic correctly identify the president as a topic and the Delft china set as a focus.
As shown in [H] and [H],
the topic the president cannot be argued against or repeated as news,
whereas the focus the Delft china set can be.

. .[H:] I'm arranging things for the president's dinner. Anything I should know?
     .[S:] Yes. [The president] [hates the Delft china set].
     .[H:] ?No, the first lady hates the Delft china set.
     .[H:] No, the president hates Rockingham Pottery.

. .[H:] I'm arranging things for the president's dinner. Anything I should know?
     .[S:] Yes. [The president] [hates the Delft china set].
     .[H:] ?Aha, the president.
     .[H:] Aha, the Delft china set.



Therefore, I conclude that
the definition BackDefTopic identifies a topic
better than the aboutness test,
although aboutness captures some aspects of our intuition about topics.



EvokednessBackEvoked

Evoked information is commonly called ``given'' or ``old'' information.
However, as pointed out in prince81,
``given'' and ``old'' are too ambiguous terms.
Following Prince,
I use the term ``evoked information'' to indicate the referent that has been mentioned in the previous discourse or has been physically present in the speaker's and the hearer's attention
and hence ``in the consciousness of the addressee [(or the hearer)] at the time of utterance'' [30]chafe76.
The term ``the focus (center) of attention'', ``anaphoric'', ``predictable'' kuno72, and ``active'' portner07 are understood in the same way.

Most researchers agree that evoked information is not the topic itself [inter alia]reinhart81,gundel88,lambrecht94.
As it is well known, evoked elements can be focus instead of topic as shown in [B].

.BackExHimself .[A:] Who did Felix praise?
     .[B:] [Felix praised] [himself.]
     .[] [72, style modified by NN]reinhart81

In [B], it is obvious that himself is evoked information
since the referent is mentioned in the previous context and in the sentence in question itself.
At the same time, it consists of focus because
it is the answer to the wh-question (see also the discussion on focus in BackSecFocus below).
Given that foci cannot be topics,
himself in [B] is not a topic.

Moreover, as has been pointed out by many scholars [see][inter alia]li76,givon83,halliday04,
topics are frequently evoked, but this is not always the case.



















Subject

As pointed out in li76,
topics are frequently, but not always, subjects.
For example, the whole utterance in [a-d] can be the answer to a question ``what happened?'',
which indicates that the subjects in these utterances are also part of focus,
not topic.

.
  .[] What happened?
  . [A man shot a lion.]
  . [It is snowing.]
  . [Someone came in.]
  . [The Mets beat the A's.]
  .[] [49, modified by NN]gundel74


Topics are not always subjects, either.
Objects and other elements can be also topics.
In ,
objects are topics.
The information structure is annotated by the current author.
It is necessary to specify the context to determine the detailed information structure.

.
 . [Beans] he won't eat.
 . [As for that dress], I promise I won't wear [it.]
 . (What about) [beans], does he like [them?]
 .[] [27, modified by NN]gundel74

However, it is also important to note that topics are frequently subjects li76.



Sentence-initial elements

chomsky65 and halliday67 characterize the topic as the sentence-initial element
(more recently, see hajicovaetal00).
To define the topic in terms of linguistic form pre-empts the goal of this study:
i.e., to figure out the association between information structures (topic and focus) and linguistic forms (particles, word order, and intonation).

Moreover, there are cases where the sentence-initial elements are not topics.
For example, the sentences in in the last section are topicless sentences;
therefore, the sentence-initial elements are not topics.

Also, topics sometimes do not appear sentence-initially.

. (What about the proposal?) -- [Archie rejected] [it/the proposal.]

We will see
topics which appear after the predicate
in Chapter WordOrder.
As will be discussed in Chapter WordOrder,
topics frequently appear sentence-finally in casual spoken Japanese and many other languages;
and post-predicate topics have their own characteristics.








































FocusBackSecFocus

In this section, I review the definitions of (or the notions closely associated with) focus.
Like topic, focus is also a controversial notion and the literature disagrees on the definition as well as the properties of focus.
Here again, I categorize different notions of focus into several representative groups in the following subsections.
But first, I introduce my definition of focus in order for the discussion to be clear.
Then, I give an overview of each definition of focus in the literature.


The definition of focus in this studyBackSubsecDefFocus

Since I try to capture the phenomena of information structure in a single layer,
I believe that topic and focus should be mutually exclusive rather than overlapping with each other
as has been mentioned above.
Therefore, I define the notion of focus as in 
(see also the discussion in FrameworkFocus).

. Focus is a discourse element that the speaker assumes to be news to the hearer and possibly controversial.
S/he wants the hearer to learn the relation of the presupposition to the focus by his/her utterance.
In other words, focus is an element that is asserted.

BackFocDef

Like BackDefTopic,
this definition also follows and elaborates the idea of focus (heisetsu-tai `plain form') in matsushita28.
He states that ``whereas the theme of judgement [topic] should not be changed before the judgement, materials to be used for the judgement [focus] are indeterminate, variate, and free since the speaker uses these materials at his/her own choice'' (p. 774, translated by NN).

I believe the statement that the speaker ``wants the hearer to learn the relation of the presupposition to the focus'' in BackFocDef is essentially the same as the definition of a comment in gundel88,
which states as follows.

. A predication, P, is the comment of a sentence, S, iff in using S the speaker intends P to be assessed relative to the topic of S.
     [210]gundel88

lambrecht94 [based on][]halliday67 also employs the same definition of focus as stated in .

. [T]he focus of a sentence, or more precisely,
  the focus of the proposition expressed by a sentence
  in a given utterance context,
  is seen as the element of information whereby the presupposition 
  and the assertion differ from each other.
  The focus is that portion of a proposition which
  cannot be taken for granted at the time of speech.
  It is the unpredictable or pragmatically
  non-recoverable element in an utterance.
  [207, underlined by the original author]lambrecht94

Unpredictability or non-recoverability [see also][]kuno72 is also very similar to definition BackFocDef.

I use the term assertion in the sense proposed by stalnaker04.
He argues that, among possible worlds, a single world is chosen by assertion.
I consider this to be equivalent to ``being news to the hearer.''
The reason why I do not simply say ``focus is the element being asserted'' is that
to single out a world from many possible worlds might be confused with contrastiveness.
As will be discussed in Back:Foc:Contr,
focushood and contrastiveness are similar but different notions.

As has been pointed out in many studies [e.g.,][]matsushita28,chomsky65,gundel74,
the answer corresponding to a wh-question is a typical focus.
The following examples are from [121]lambrecht94.
The interpretation of information structure is of the current author
and might slightly differ from Lambrecht's original intention.

. BackLambPredFocPredicate focus
	.[Q:] What did the children do next?
	.[A:] [The children] [went to school.]

. BackLambArgFocArgument focus
	.[Q:] Who went to school?
	.[A:] [The children] [went to school.]

. BackLambAllFocSentence focus
	.[Q:] What happened?
	.[A:] [The children went to school.]


Focus is news (or newsworthy in mithun95) for the hearer and can be repeated as what s/he learned from the current utterance.
For example, in ,
the topic John in [A] cannot be repeated as news by B,
whereas (part of) the focus teacher can be repeated by B.

. .[A:] [As for/Regarding John], [he] [is a teacher].
     .[B:] ??Aha, John.
     .[B:] Aha, a teacher.


No tests based on erteschik-shir07 are also available.
See discussion in FrameworkFocus.
Identifying focus by
wh-question-answer pairs (BackLambPredFoc-BackLambAllFoc) or the aha test 
is based on the assumption that
foci are news or newsworthy,
while no tests like BackExJohn2 in FrameworkFocus are based on the assumption that
foci can be controversial.

In the following sections,
I review various notions associated with foci
and how they relate to the discussion of foci in the present work.


Newness

Newness is known to correlate with focushood [inter alia]li76,givon83,halliday04.
Although different researchers use the term new to refer to different concepts,
I use this term to indicate strictly ``new'' in terms of prince81 or ``what the speaker assumes he is introducing into the addressee's consciousness by what he says'' [30]chafe76.
Other newness, what is called ``relational new'' in gundel88,
is excluded from the current discussion.
According to [177]gundelfretheim06, relational newness is described as follows.

. Y [focus] is new in relation to X [topic] in the sense that
     it is new information that is asserted, questioned, etc. about X.
     Relational [...] newness thus reflects how the informational content of a particular event or state of affairs expressed by a sentence is represented and how its truth value is to be assessed.

The notion of ``relational new'' corresponds to focus in this study and the notion of comment in gundel88.



The literature agrees that
not all foci are new.
As discussed in BackEvoked,
focus can be an evoked element.
BackExHimself, repeated here as ,
is an example of this case;
himself in [B] is evoked because the referent ``Felix'' has already been mentioned in the preceding utterance [A],
and, at the same time, it serves as focus because it corresponds to the answer part of wh-question in [A].

. .[A:] Who did Felix praise?
     .[B:] [Felix praised] [himself.]
     .[] [72, style modified by NN]reinhart81


On the other hand,
all new elements can be foci.
It is well known that, in English, (specific or non-generic) indefinite noun phrases cannot be topics.
For example, gundel74, discussing the following examples,
concludes that indefinite noun phrases cannot be topics.
As shown in [a] and [a],
indefinite noun phrases cannot be put in the frame concerning and about;
nor can they appear in the frame what about.

. 
  . *Concerning a French king, he married his mother.
  . *What about a French king? -- He married his mother.
  .[] [54]gundel74

.
  . *About a lion, Bill shot him.
  . *What about a lion? -- Bill shot him.
     (ibid.)


I argue that new elements that have been known to the hearer before the utterance, i.e., ``unused'' in terms of prince81, can be either topic or foci.
They are new in the sense that the speaker is introducing them into the hearer's consciousness by what s/he says;
but they are given in the sense that they are assumed by the speaker to be shared with the hearer.
In Chapter WordOrder,
I argue that in fact unused elements have characteristics of both topics and foci.
























ContrastivenessBack:Foc:Contr

Many studies, particularly in generative linguistics,
associate focushood with contrastiveness (frequently accompanied with pitch peak).
Here I base my discussion on rooth85,rooth92,
who was inspired by vonstechow91,
since his theory is one of the most influential studies on focus as contrastive.

In his theory, alternative semantics,
where focus is related to the intuitive notion of contrast,
Rooth argues that the function of focus is to evoke alternatives;
in other words,
the focused element is contrasted with the alternatives.
For example, consider in two cases
where Mary is focused and Sue is focused.

. Mary likes Sue.

The former case evokes the set of propositions of the form `x likes Sue'
as formalized in [a],
whereas the latter case evokes the set of propositions of the form `Mary likes y', as formalized in [b].

.
  . [ [Mary] likes Sue] = like(x,s)  x  , where  is the domain of individuals.
  . [ Mary likes [Sue]] = like(m,y)  y  
  .[] [76]rooth92

Among the members of these sets,
Mary is chosen as the one who likes Sue in [a],
and Sue is chosen as the one who Mary likes in [b].

Characterization and formalization of focus by alternative semantics is
clear and seems to work well.
However, characterizing foci as contrastive is problematic
for our assumptions;
whereas we have assumed that topic and focus are mutually exclusive,
there can be both contrastive topic and contrastive focus
as has been pointed out in vallduvivilkuna98.
Especially problematic for us is the existence of contrastive topics.
If contrastiveness is equal to focushood,
one has to admit that contrastive topic is both topic and focus.

Following vallduvivilkuna98,
I argue that this is very confusing for a theory of information structure and
it is more plausible to assume that contrastiveness is a feature independent of both topichood and focushood.
For example,
as will be discussed in Chapter Particles,
the particle wa in Japanese is sensitive to some properties of topichood,
whereas the particle ga is sensitive to some properties of focushood.
In addition to this,
these two particles are also sensitive to contrastiveness;
these particles are obligatory for contrastiveness,
while, in other cases, they are optional.
Still, contrastive wa and ga are sensitive to topichood and focushood, respectively.
Therefore, this study

assumes that
contrastiveness is independent of topic and focus.
However, it is highly likely that other languages work differently.
Further study is needed to investigate whether contrastiveness is independent of topic and focus in all languages.







Pitch peak

Some studies assume that focus is a pitch peak.
For example, [100]chomsky96 states that
``phrases that contain the intonation center [pitch peak in the present work] may be interpreted as focus of utterance''.
As [230]gundel88 reports,
the association between a pitch peak and focus
is found in typologically, genetically, and geographically diverse languages
and concludes that this association seems to be universal.
According to her,
a focus is given a pitch peak at least in English, Guarani, Russian and Turkish
with the only exception of Hixkaryana (see also the references in her work and buring07).
 
See downing12 for more exceptions.



As has been pointed out in previous studies on other languages (e.g., [6.2]jackendoff72),

however,
I do not employ the definition of focus as pitch peak
because the goal of this study is to investigate the association between information structure and linguistic forms including intonation;
the definition of focus as pitch peak spoils the goal of our study.
Moreover,
I will argue in Chapter Intonation that 
elements other than focus are given pitch peak.
For example, a topic that is reintroduced in the discourse is produced prominently [see also][]gundel99.
It is also well known that
contrastiveness correlates with pitch peak.
Therefore, regarding focus as elements with pitch peak causes great confusion.















Characteristics of JapaneseBackSecCharJap

In this section, I provide a rough overview of the typological characteristics of Japanese.
Most of the literature on Japanese is based on written language;
therefore, most of this section (except for sound parts such as intonation) is also based on written Japanese.
I discuss the difference between written and spoken Japanese
where necessary.



General characteristicsBackSubSecGeneralChar

Japanese is an SOV language, with typical OV characteristics
in terms of dryer07;
it has postpositions (which are called particles in this study),
genitives precede nouns,
adverbial subordinators appear after the verbs,
main verbs precede auxiliary verbs,
question particles and complementizer appear after the verbs,
subordinate clauses precede main clauses, and
relative clauses precede the nouns
shibatani90,masuokatakubo92.
Moreover,
nouns are preceded by adjectives and demonstratives,
and verbs are followed by many kinds of suffixes indicating tense, modality, negation, passive, causative, and so on.
shows some examples of Japanese sentences.
``A'' stands for the agent-like argument of transitive clauses;
``S'' stands for the only argument of intransitive clauses; and
``P'' stands for the patient-like argument of transitive clauses.

.
     . taroo-ga hanako-ni hon-o yat-ta 

        Taro-nom Hanako-dat book-acc give-past 

        `Taro gave a book to Hanako.' (A + DAT + P + V)
     . sono san-nin-no ookina otoko 

          that three-cl.person-gen big man 

          `those three big men' (Adj + N)
     . taroo-no hon 

          Taro-gen book 

          `Taro's book' (GEN + N)
     . [taroo-ga kat-ta] hon 

           Taro-nom buy-past book 

           `the book Taro bought' (Rel + N)
     . ik-e-nai 

          go-cap-neg 

          `cannot go' (V + SFX1 + SFX2) 

     .[] [257--258, glosses modified by NN]shibatani90

The features of Japanese mosst relevant in this study are the order of the subject, the object, and the verb and the order of nouns and particles.
Also, as will be discussed in BackSubSecWO,
arguments such as subjects and objects can be `scrambled';
i.e., word orders other than the basic word order are found in both spoken and written Japanese.

The particles ga and o, which follow nouns, are considered to be a nominative particle and an accusative particle respectively in written Japanese,
and accordingly Shibatani glossed them as such.
As will be discussed below, however,
the zero particles are extensively used in spoken Japanese and
the characterization of ga as the nominative marker and o as the accusative marker does not necessarily reflect the exact properties of these particles.
Since the literature is mainly based on written Japanese,
I keep the glosses of nom for ga and acc for o in this chapter.
In the same way, I will use top for wa since
most literature agrees that wa is a topic marker (no matter what it means),
although, again, the zero particle is extensively used in the spoken language.
But keep in mind that the glosses are tentative.
I will not use nom acc, and top in the following chapters;
instead, I just gloss ga, o, and wa for each particle.

Japanese extensively employs so-called zero pronouns.
In , for example,
pronouns such as `I', `him', and `it' are not explicitly uttered.

.
 . zyon-ga ki-ta-node, ai-ni it-ta 

      John-nom come-past-since meet-dat go-past 

      ``Since John came, (I) went to see (him),''
 . zyon-ga dekire-ba suru-desyoo 

      John-nom can-if do-will 

      ``If John can (do it), (he) will do (it).''
      [17]kuno73

These omitted pronouns are sensitive to the information status of the referents [see][Chapter 1]kuno78.


The language has five vowels and 15 consonants (although the number may vary depending on the analysis).
The syllable structures are relatively simple;
a syllable basically consists of a consonant and a vowel,
whereas long vowels, geminates, final nasal coda are possible.
Also, /y/ ([j]) can appear between a consonant and a vowel
as in kyoo ([kjo:]) `today' as opposed to koo ([ko:]) `this way'.
The pitch accent plays an important role.
The systems of pitch accent vary among Japanese dialects,
and here I review the accent system of Standard Japanese (spoken around Tokyo),
which is to be investigated in the present study.
First, in Standard Japanese,
the pitch is either high or low, and
the pitches of the first and the second syllables are different.
If the first syllable is high, the second syllable is low,
and vice versa.
Second, the accent nucleus (indicated by ) specifies where the pitch falls.
For example,
[haCi] `chopsticks' indicates that [ha] is high and [Ci] is low.
On the other hand, [haCi] `bridge' indicates that
[ha] is low and [Ci] is high.
Words without nucleus accents are also possible as in the case of [haCi] `edge',
which is pronounced in the same way as `bridge'.
The distinction between [haCi] `bridge' and [haCi] `edge' can be made, for example, by the following particles without accents.
For example, when ga `nom' follows [haCi] `bridge', the pitch of ga is low
because the accent nucleus specifies where the pitch falls.
On the other hand, when ga follows [haCi] `edge', ga is produced in a high pitch.
Thereby [haCi] `bridge' and [haCi] `edge' can be distinguished from each other.
In addition to phonemes and pitch accents,
there are also issues on intonation, which will be discussed in the following section (BackSubIntonation) in more detail since it is one of the main topics of this study.



ParticlesBackSubSecParticles

As mentioned above,
nouns in Japanese are followed by various particles or postpositions.
In general, they are believed to be clitics and indicate the status of a noun in a clause.
  
 Although the equal sign (=) is usually used for clitic boundaries,
 I use the hyphen (-) and do not distinguish clitics from affixes for the sake of simplicity.
 
In this section, I review the literature on ga, o, and wa,
which are to be investigated in this study.
Note again that the literature is mainly on written Japanese.
In BackSubSubZero,
I present a review of the literature on the zero particles,
which are widely used in spoken Japanese in place of ga, o, and wa.


Case particles vs. adverbial particles

In the present study,
I discuss two kinds of particles that attach to nouns:
case and adverbial particles.
Case particles such as ga and o
code grammatical relations of nouns.
For example, in ,
ga, following a noun taroo, codes nominative case,
whereas o, following a noun hon `book', codes accusative case.

.ExShibatani90257taroo-ga hanako-ni hon-o yat-ta 

        Taro-nom Hanako-dat book-acc give-past 

        `Taro gave a book to Hanako.'
  [257]shibatani90


Adverbial particles, on the other hand,
sometimes follow and sometimes replace case particles
and add additional meaning to the sentence.
The adverbial particle discussed in this study is wa.
  
 There are other adverbial particles such as mo `also' and dake `only',
 which also follow or replace case particles.
 As the glosses `also' and `only' suggest,
 they are translated like adverbs in English,
 which is part of the reason why they are called ``adverbial'' particles.
 
Wa can replace ga and o and change the noun into ``topic''.
It sometimes replaces with and sometimes follows ni `dat'.
For example,
each noun in can be wa-marked in the following ways.

. . taroo-wa hanako-ni hon-o yat-ta 

        Taro-nom-top Hanako-dat book-acc give-past 

        `Regarding Taro, he gave a book to Hanako.'
 . hon-wa taroo-ga hanako-ni yat-ta 

      book-top Taro-top Hanako-dat give-past 

        `Regarding the book, Taro gave it to Hanako.'
 . hanako-(ni)-wa taroo-ga hon-o yat-ta 

      Hanako-(dat)-top Taro-top book-acc give-past 

        `Regarding Hanako, Taro gave a book to her.'

There are complex interactions between wa-marking and word order [e.g.,][]kuroda79,
which is to be discussed in Chapter WordOrder.



Ga

Almost all studies agree that
ga in contemporary Japanese is a case marker that codes nominative case [e.g.,][]yamada36,kuno73,tanaka77,shibatani90.
Ga is also said to code the ``subject'' [e.g.,][164]kuroda79.

It has some important characteristics in addition to coding nominative case;
it can code genitive and object (in terms of this study, P).
I do not introduce these usages since they are irrelevant to the present work.
See, for example, ono75,nishida77,yasuda77,kuno73,shibatani01.

Recent studies are more interested in the mapping between
surface form (such as ga and o)
and the semantic (or deep) structure of predicates.
See kondo03 for the survey of such studies.



























































































Exhaustive listing vs. neutral description

kuno73 distinguishes two types of ga:
exhaustive listing and neutral description.
In terms of the present study,
exhaustive listing corresponds to argument focus (or narrow focus),
while neutral description corresponds to part of predicate focus and sentence focus (or broad focus),
although whether the latter ga codes focus or not is controversial
as will be discussed below.
Examples [a-b] are instances of exhaustive listing and
neutral description, respectively.

.
 . Exhaustive listing
 .[] zyon-ga gakusei-desu 

      John-nom student-cop.plt 

      `(Of all the people under discussion) John (and only John) is a student.' 

      `It is John who is a student.'
 . Neutral description
 .[] ame-ga hutte i-masu 

      rain-nom fall prog-plt 

      ``It is raining.''
      [38]kuno73

Kuno, following kuroda79,
proposes that
ga of neutral description can only code
the subject (As and Ss in this study) of action verbs,
existential verbs, and
adjectives/nominal adjectives
that represent changing states,
whereas ga of exhaustive listing can attach to any kinds of nouns.
This is not the topic of the present work,
which does not examine
the associations between information structure and predicate types,
although this is a very important topic.
See [Chapter 4]masuoka00,
which extensively discusses this issue.



Ga as focus marker

Lastly but most importantly in the present work,
ga is sometimes described as a focus marker.
Ga of exhaustive listing in kuno73 corresponds to
ga as a focus marker heycock08.


Ga coding new (unpredictable) information [Chapter 25]kuno73j is also related to ga coding focus.

noda95 classifies ga of exhaustive-listing into focus markers, or toritate particles,
while he argues that ga of neutral description is a case marker.
  
 tokieda50 classifies some uses of ga into ``particles which represents limitation'' (p. 188ff.),
 which are also close to focus markers.
 
Toritate can be literally translated as `taking up'
and is intended to mean `to make something remarkable'.
Toritate particles are defined as
particles that make part of a sentence or a phrase remarkable and emphasize that part [178]miyata48.
Toritate particles include mo `also', sae `even',
dake `only', etc.,
which are in general classified into focus markers in other languages.
Therefore, I conclude that toritate particles, including ga with exhaustive-listing readings, correspond to
focus particles.
  
 However, many researchers also classify the so-called topic marker 
 wa into toritate particles;
 some of them only include contrastive wa  okutsu74,okutsu86,numata86,
 others include both contrastive and non-contrastive wa
 miyata48,suzuki72,teramura81,noda95.
 Although I do not believe that wa, including contrastive wa, is a focus marker,
 the notions of focushood and contrastiveness are frequently confused,
 but should be discussed independently.
 Therefore, I regard toritate particles as focus markers
 in other languages.

onoetal00 go further and claim that
ga in natural conversation does not code As and Ss;
rather, they claim that
``ga is well characterized as marking that its NP is to be construed as a participant in the state-of-affairs named by the predicate in pragmatically highly marked situations'' (p. 65).
In other words,
``ga is found in pragmatically highly marked situations where
there is something unpredictable about the relationship between
the ga-marked NP and the predicate such that
an explicit signalling of that relationship becomes interactionally or cognitively relevant'' (ibid.).
Although it is not perfectly clear what they mean by
``pragmatically marked situations'',
part of what they mean is that
ga functions as a focus marker
because they use ga coding new or unpredictable information
as a piece of evidence that supports their claim.
In [b], for example,
ga codes the answer to the question
`what club (are you going to) join?' in [a].

.
 . nani-ni hai-n-da 

      what-dat enter-nmlz-cop 

      `What (club are you going) to join?'
 . handobooru-ga ii-kana-toka omotte [...] 

      handball-nom good--q-hdg think 

      `(It's) handball (I want to join), (I) think.' 

 .[]     [70]onoetal00



Remaining issues

It is indeed the case that
ga sometimes codes nouns other than nominative
as shown in .
(See Chapter Particles for detailed discussion.)
In [a], ga follows the postposition kara `from (abl)';
the noun cannot be nominative.
In a similar manner,
ga follows to `with (com)' in [b] and
made `til (lim)' in [c].
  ExFocGa is not acceptable for some people.

       I found 32,700 websites using this expression with Google exact search (searched on 06/17/2015).
       




As will be discussed in detail in Chapter Particles,
this type of ga codes focus rather than nominative case.
However, it is too extreme to claim that all kinds of ga do not code nominative.
For example, it is never possible to replace
o in ExShibatani90257 with ga
no matter how much hon `book' is focalized.
It is clear that ga sometimes codes nominative, sometimes codes a focus, and sometimes codes both.
Also, as will be outlined below,
the zero particles are extensively used in spoken Japanese.
Therefore, the question is under what conditions ga codes focus,
under what conditions it codes nominative,
and when ga is used instead of the zero particles.
Also, what motivates ga to code a focus?
It is not appropriate to discuss
whether ga codes a focus or nominative case.
I discuss these issues in Chapter Particles.




O

There are fewer studies on the particle o and,
as far as I am aware, almost all studies agree that o is an accusative marker
and codes the patient-like argument in a transitive clause [e.g.,][]yamada36,shibatani90.
In this section,
there are some non-canonical usages of the particle o:
coding time and place of transferring yamada36.






























































Remaining issues

Both of these non-canonical usages of o are a matter of the mapping
between surface forms and semantic structures,
as I discussed in the paragraph on ga of ``object'' marking.
Therefore, I consider these issues to be independent of
issues of information structure.

Like ga,
the zero particles are extensively used instead of o in spoken Japanese.
It is therefore necessary to investigate the distribution of the zero particles and o.
I propose the conditions for the zero particles and o in Chapter Particles.
I will give an overview of the literature on the zero particles in BackSubSubZero.





WaBack:GeneralChar:Wa






The adverbial particle wa has been widely discussed in the literature
because the conditions on where it appears are very complex and subtle.

In the early literature of modern linguistics on Japanese,
wa was confused with a nominative marker
because most of the time wa codes so-called nominative case in place of ga.
According to [2]aoki92,
who studied more than 10,000 examples of wa
in novels and essays,
76.7 of wa codes nominative case, and
84.7 of wa-marked nouns code nominative case.
Moreover,
wa appears to ``replace'' ga.
For example,
the sentences in [a] with wa and [b] with ga
are truth-conditionally equivalent, and
replacing one particle with the other does not affect the truth value
of the sentence.

.
 . zyon-wa gakusei-desu 

      John-top student-cop.plt 

      `John is a student.'
 . zyon-ga gakusei-desu 

      John-nom student-cop.plt 

      `John is a student.'
      [38]kuno73

In the same way,
[a] and [b] are truth-conditionally equivalent.

.
 . ame-wa hutte i-masu-ga... 

      rain-top fall prog-plt-though 

      `It is raining, but...'
 . ame-ga hutte i-masu 

      rain-nom fall prog-plt 

      `It is raining.'
      (ibid.)

Therefore, wa was considered to code nominative case like ga.

[472ff.]yamada36 pointed out that
wa should be classified as an adverbial particle (kakari joshi)
  
 Yamada distinguishes kakari joshi from fuku joshi.
 Although the English term adverbial particle sounds closer to
 fuku joshi,
 I use the term adverbial particle to include both
 kakari joshi and fuku joshi
 because this distinction does not matter for now. 
 
and should not be confused with case particles such as ga.
However, since wa codes nominative case most of the time,
wa has been analyzed as opposed to ga.
The nature of wa has been so widely discussed, and
I can only give a simplified overview of representative analyses of wa below,
each of which captures a certain aspect of wa.
onoe77 is a useful survey of the history of studies on wa,
and noda96 is a good summary of contemporary studies.
Here I focus on wa-marked nouns and put aside the other types of wa.
For other types of wa,
see, for example, [Chapter 7]teramura91.


The most popular analysis of wa
is that wa is a topic marker,
which was proposed by matsushita28.
  
 According to onoe77,
 this was first proposed in Ayuisho by Fujitani Nariakira (1778).
 
However, the definition topic itself is controversial in the literature
as we have seen in BackSecTopic.
So, the question of what ``a topic marker'' is still remains.
I will outline various aspects of wa proposed in the literature.


Givenness

The first characterization of wa is that
wa codes given information
[233]chafe70.
kuno73 also makes a similar claim;
wa codes anaphoric information,
i.e.,
information that has been ``entered into the registry of the
present discourse'' (45).
According to kuno73, for example,
[a] is unacceptable because
ame `rain' has not been entered into the present registry,
whereas [b] is acceptable because
wa-coded ame `rain' has been registered.
Note that the first-mentioned ame was coded by ga in [b].

.
 . *ame-wa hutte i-masu 

       rain-top fall prog-plt 

       `Speaking of rain, it is falling.'
 . asa hayaku ame-ga huri dasi-ta... yoru-ni natte-mo ame-wa hutte i-ta 

       morning early rain-nom fall start-past night-dat become-also rain-top fall prog-past

       `It started raining early in the morning...
       Speaking of the rain, it was still falling even at night.'
       [45]kuno73


The analysis that wa codes given information
explains the fact that
wa cannot attach to nouns such as wh-phrases like [a],
quantified noun phrases like [b],
and indefinite pronouns like [c].
They represent new information and have not been entered into the registry of temporary discourse.

.
 . *dare-wa ki-masi-ta-ka 

       who-top come-plt-past-q 

       `Who came?'
       [37]kuno73
 . *oozei-no hito-wa paathii-ni ki-masi-ta 

       many-gen person-top party-dat come-plt-past 

       `Speaking of many people, they came to the party.'
       (op.cit.: 45)
 . *dareka-wa byooki-desu 

       somebody-top sick-cop.plt

       `Speaking of somebody, he is sick.'
       (ibid.)


Although I believe that Kuno's observation explains
a condition of wa-coding well,
his claim needs to be supported by more natural data
because his grammatical judgements are not always agreeable to many native speakers of Japanese.
Moreover,
as will be discussed in Chapter Particles,
78 (41.1) out of 190 cases of wa codes new (non-anaphoric) information, i.e., nouns without antecedents in the previous contexts. 
Most of them are neither generic nor contrastive and need explanation.
I will discuss the conditions of the use of wa
in Chapter Particles.



Generic wa

kuroda72 and kuno73 argue that
generic nouns can be always coded by wa.
  
 kuroda72 pays more attention to generic events rather than
 just nouns.
 
According to kuno72,
this is because they are ``in the permanent registry of discourse,
and do not have to be reentered into the temporary registry for each discourse'' (p. 41).
For example, the sentences in are acceptable in an out-of-the-blue context.

.
 . kuzira-wa honyuu-doobutu-desu 

      whale-top mammal-animal-cop.plt 

      `Speaking of whales, they are mammals. (A whale is a mammal.)'
      [44]kuno73
 . hito-wa sinu (mono-desu) 

      person-top die (thing-cop.plt)

      `Human beings die. (All humans are mortal.)'
      (Constructed)


In Chapter Particles, however,
I will show that not all generic nouns can be felicitously coded by wa in an out-of-the-blue context.
Instead, I propose that
the generic condition of wa-coding is integrated into
the givenness condition of wa.



Contrastive wa

kuno73 distinguishes wa coding given (in his term, anaphoric) information
from that coding contrastive information.
He argues that the contrastive wa can code new (in his term, ``non-anaphoric'') information
as shown in the contrast between [a] and [b].
According to Kuno,
oozei-no hito `many people' in [a] is new and non-contrastive;
therefore, the sentence is not acceptable.
On the other hand, oozei-no hito `many people' in [b] is new but contrasted with omosiroi hito `interesting person';
in this case, the sentence is acceptable.
The contrastive wa is typically accompanied by high pitch.
Note that the acceptability judgements as well as examples are from Kuno and
in particular [b] is not acceptable to some people (including the current author).

.
 . *oozei-no hito-wa paathii-ni ki-masi-ta 

       many-gen person-EM party-dat come-plt-past 

       `Speaking of many people, they came to the party.'
       (Non-contrastive)
 . oozei-no hito-wa paathii-ni ki-masi-ta-ga omosiroi hito-wa hitori-mo i-mase-n-desi-ta 

       many-gen person-top party-dat come-plt-past-though interesting people-top single-also exist-plt-neg-plt-past 

       `Many people came to the party indeed, but there was none who was interesting.'
       (Contrastive)
 .[] [47]kuno73

The contrast between [a] and [b] is explained in the same way.
.
 . *ame-wa hutte i-masu 

       rain-top fall prog-plt 

       `Speaking of rain, it is falling.'
       (Non-contrastive)
 . ame-wa hutte i-masu-ga taisita koto-wa ari-mase-n 

       rain-top fall prog-plt-though serious matter-top exist-plt-neg 

       `It is raining, but it is not much.'
       (Contrastive)
 .[] [46]kuno73










While some studies like kuno73 assume that
the contrastive wa and non-contrastive wa are independent and mutually exclusive,
others like teramura91 speculate that
they are governed by the same condition(s).
teramura91
claims that the basic property of wa is to contrast one with the other(s) and
the non-contrastive wa appears when the contrasted elements are not noticed.








hara08
shows that the contrastive wa always induces scalar implicatures as in [a] and
proposes a formal analysis of the contrastive wa.
Furthermore,
hara06 argues that the implicatures induced by the contrastive wa
are conventional implicatures, rather than conversational implicatures.

.
 . nanninka-wa ki-ta 

      some.people-top come-past 

      `Some people came.'

      (Implicature: it is possible that it is not the case that
      everyone came.)
  . minna-wa ki-ta 

        everyone-top come-past 

        `Everyone came.'

        (No implicature possible.)
  .[] [36]hara06












The present study does not aim at investigating detailed characteristics of
the contrastive wa;
rather, I am more interested in capturing various aspects of wa as a whole,
including contrastive wa,
and giving a unified explanation of wa.
Therefore, issues like the syntactic position of the contrastive wa,
the interaction between contrast and negation or quantifiers,
and their formal analyses
are outside of the scope of this study.
In Chapter Particles,
I will argue that the contrastive and non-contrastive wa can be explained consistently in a single principle
along the lines of teramura91.











































































































Characterization of wa based on judgement types






































































































kuroda72,
inspired by Branz Brentano and Anton Marty,
proposed the distinction between wa vs. ga
based on the categorical vs. thetic judgements.
According to Kuroda,
``the categorical judgement is assumed to consist of two separate acts,
one, the act of recognition of that which is to be made the subject,
and the other, the act of affirming or denying what is expressed by the predicate about the subject'' (p. 154).
On the other hand,
the thetic judgement ``represents simply the recognition or rejection of material of a judgement'' (ibid.).
Kuroda argues that
sentences with wa like [a] correspond to the categorical judgement and
those with ga like [b] correspond to the thetic judgement.

.
 . inu-wa neko-o oikakete iru 

      dog-top cat-acc chase prog 

      `The dog is chasing a/the cat.'
      (Categorical judgement)
 . inu-ga neko-o oikakete iru 

      dog-nom cat-acc chase prog 

      `A/The dog is chasing a/the cat.'
      (Thetic judgement)
 .[] [161]kuroda72

The categorical judgement roughly corresponds to the predicate-focus structure, and
the thetic judgement corresponds to the sentence-focus structure.



I assume that some part of judgement types can be reduced into particles.
Therefore, the theory of judgement types and particles are compatible and complement each other.
In the present study,
I only focus on the distinction among particles
and leave the rest for future studies.


Cohesion

clancydowning87,
analyzing spoken narratives, suggest that
``wa-marking is not necessary to establish thematic status, nor does wa-marking, when it appears, necessarily indicate that the participant in question is thematic, to the extent that
thematicity can be equated with the measures that [they] have considered,
i.e., the frequency of appearance, persistence, or ability to elicit zero switch reference'' (p. 24),
contrary to other studies such as maynard80.
They conclude that
``the primary function of wa is to serve as a local cohesive device,
linking textual elements of varying degrees of contrastivity'' (p. 46)
because ``the majority of wa uses in [their] data,
whether thematic or locally contrastive or both,
occurred on switch subjects,
i.e., references to participants who by definition had been non-subjects when last mentioned'' (ibid.).

I investigated whether this generalization applies to
my data, CSJ (the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese), which also includes spoken narratives as will be explained in the next chapter.
First, I extracted all wa-coded NPs and pronouns and their antecedent NPs and pronouns.
Then, I categorized the antecedents into
so-called subjects (ga-coded NPs),
objects (o-coded NPs), and datives (ni-coded NPs) and
counted their numbers.
As a result,
it turned out that
13 subjects, 11 objects, and 10 datives are the antecedents of
wa-coded NPs or pronouns.
Although the numbers are very small and it is inappropriate to generalize based on them,
it is clear that
Clancy and Downing's claim does not hold in my data.

Moreover, watanabe89, analyzing corpora, argues that
wa codes important and definite nouns, contrary to clancydowning87
Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine their claim.




Isolation



It has been pointed out that
wa isolates the wa-marked nouns from the rest of a sentence.
onoe77 reports that this issue was observed in the 19th century
in studies like Colloquial Japanese by Brown (1863) and
Japansche Spraakleer by Hoffmann (1868).
[103]onoe81, supporting this view,
argues that a sentence with ga as in [a] expresses a unified situation,
whereas that with wa as in [b] isolates or separates
the noun from the predicate,
in this case
sora `sky' from aoi `blue',
and then associates these two.

.
 . sora-ga aoi 

      sky-nom blue 

      `The sky is blue.'
 . sora-wa aoi 

      sky-top blue 

      `The sky is blue.'

He further argues that
wa ``drastically confirms the thetic judgement `the sky is blue''' (ibid.).

While I believe that this characterization captures
some aspect of wa,
it needs to be captured in a theory and supported by more data.
  
 Onoe seems to think that the existence of the contrastive wa
 supports wa's ``isolation'' function.
 However, the connection between isolation and contrastiveness is not clear to me.
 
For example,
ga in [a] also separates sora from aoi because
there is a phrase boundary.
Where does the intuition of wa's ``isolation'' come from?
In Chapter Intonation,
I argue that there is an intonation boundary between a topic and a focus;
therefore, topics including wa-coded elements are intonationally separated from foci.



Remaining issues

As I have mentioned above,
the aim of this study is to give a consistent explanation of wa-coding,
rather than to give a detailed model of some aspect of wa.
The characteristics of wa summarized above reflect some aspects of wa.
I will propose the conditions of wa-coding capturing wa as a whole.
As I also stated above,
the properties of predicates and sentence types are outside of the scope of this study.
However, I believe that characterizing the particle wa will help us to understand other unexplained features in the future.


Toiuno-waBack:GeneralChar:Toiunowa

In this section,
I discuss the marker toiuno-wa,
which is to be investigated in the present study.
It consists of at least four morphemes as shown in .

. to iu-no-wa 

	quot call-one-wa 


The first morpheme to is a quotation marker,
and iu corresponds to `call' (or, more closely, `heissen' in German).
is an example of how to and iu, which is realized as to ii, are used.

. hasi-wa tyuugoku-go-de nan-to ii-masu-ka 

		chopstick-top China-language-in what-quot call-plt-q 

		`How do you call ``chopsticks'' in Chinese?'
		[][p. 81]masuokatakubo92

The morpheme no is a nominalizer which corresponds to `one' (as in this one) in English.
It can be used when restrictively modified nouns are repeated or are clear from the context (p. 160).

. kono seetaa-wa tiisai-node ookii-no-to kaete kudasai 

	this sweater-top small-because big-one-with exchange please 

	`Since this sweater is too small, please exchange this with a bigger one.'
	(op. cit.: p. 160)

masuokatakubo92 point out that
the combination of noun + to iu + mono (`thing') is used
when the speaker is talking about the category in general,
rather than a specific referent of the noun.
For example, kyoosi `teacher' in [a] simply refers to specific teachers,
whereas kyoosi followed by -to iu mono in [b] refers to teachers in general rather than specific teachers.

.
 . sotugyoo-paatii-ni-wa kyoosi-ga 20-mei seito-ga 140-mei syusseki si-ta 

	graduation-party-dat-top teacher-nom 20-cl student-nom 140-cl attend do-past 

	`In the graduation party, 20 teachers and 140 students participated.'
	(Specific teachers)
 . kyoosi-to iu mono-wa tuneni aizyoo-o mot-te seeto-o mitibika-nakere-ba nara-nai 

 teacher-quot call thing-top always love-acc have-and student-acc lead-neg-cond become-neg 

 `Teachers always must lead their students with love.'
 (Teachers in general)
 flushright
 	(op. cit.: p. 34)
 flushright


This also applies to no;
no also refers to some category in general rather than a specific entity.
In fact, mono in [b] can be replaced with no without changing the meaning.
The morpheme wa is the same wa discussed in the previous section.

Unless I am discussing the compositional meanings of to iu no-wa,
I will put no space in toiuno
because sometimes it is reduced into (t)teno, t(y)uuno, or even [tW:n@].
I separate wa to keep the relationships between toiuno-wa and wa transparent,
although wa sometimes merges into toiuno
and realizes as [tW:n@:], [t:Ena:], [tsW:na:], etc.

Whereas other combinations such as toiuno-ga and toiuno-o are possible,
I focus on toiuno-wa because other combinations are rare in the corpus.
Since there are only a few studies on toiuno-wa itself,
I also include studies on toiu (without no-wa) in the following overview.




Basic usage

According to takubo89,
the combination of
toiu and basic category nouns (such as hito `person' and mono `thing') is sometimes used to introduce proper names that the hearer is assumed not to know.

. kinoo tanaka siroo-toiu hito-ni ai-masi-ta 

	yesterday Tanaka Shiro-called person-dat meet-plt-past 

	`Yesterday I met a person called Shiro Tanaka.'
	[][p. 218]takubo89


Similarly, kijutubumpokenkyukai09 describes toiuno-wa as
``presenting an expression as a topic and explaining the meaning or
attributing a noun to a specific referent'' (p. 230).
[a] exemplifies the former, and
[b] exemplifies the latter.

.
 . dokukinhoo-toiuno-wa dokusen-kinsi-hoo-no ryaku-dearu 

      dokukinhoo-toiuno-wa monopoly-ban-law-gen abbreviation-cop 

      `The expression dokukinhoo stands for dokusen-kinsi-hoo (competition law).'
 . satoo-san-toiuno-wa eigyoo-bu-no satoo-san-desu-ka zinzi-bu-no satoo-san-desu-ka

      Sato-hon-toiuno-wa sales-section-gen Sato-hon-cop-q personnel-section-gen Sato-hon-cop-q

      `Which do you mean by ``Mr.Sato'', the person in the sales section or the person in the personnel section?'
      [230]kijutubumpokenkyukai09


Sentences with toiuno-wa also express
the topics' general properties or the judgement of what they should be.
[a] is an example of the former, and
[b] is that of the latter.

.
 . suzuki-tteiuno-wa aaiu yatu-da-yo 

      Suzuki-toiuno-wa that.kind guy-cop-fp 

      `Suzuki is that kind of guy.'
 . kagaku-toiuno-wa honrai heewa-no tame-ni yakudateru-beki mono-da 

      science-toiuno-wa essentially peace-gen sake-for use-should thing-cop 

      `We should use science for the sake of peace.'
      (op.cit.: 231)



Characterization of toiuno-wa based on predication types

masuoka12, inspired by sakuma41,
analyzes the association between predication types and
the marker toiuno-wa and concludes that
toiuno-wa is a topic marker only for property predication (or individual-level predication),
as opposed to event predication (or stage-level predication).
Property predication states a property of a referent masuoka87,masuoka08.
The property is unbounded by space or time.
Masuoka states that property predication corresponds to
individual-level predication proposed in carlson77.
 
 
 
 However, property predication and individual-level predication are
 not exactly the same because
 according to masuoka08p,
 the following examples are classified into property predication,
 which are typically considered to be stage-level predication rather than
 individual-level predication.
 .
  . That person is busy.
  . My friend has been to / went to France many times.
  .[] [5--6, translated by NN]masuoka08p
 
 Masuoka states that they are atypical property predication.
 Anyway, I do not get involved in the issue of predicate types in the present study.
 
exemplifies property predication.
They are true regardless of time and space and hence
they are unbound by time and space.

.
 . Japan is an island country.
 . That person is kind.
 .[] [4, translated by NN]masuoka08p

On the other hand,
event predication describes an event bound by time and space like .

. A child smiled.  (op.cit.: 5)

This corresponds to stage-level predication in carlson77.

To see that toiuno-wa is a marker only for property predication,
compare the following examples.
In [a], which expresses event predication bound by space and time,
toiuno-wa cannot be felicitously used,
while, in [b], which expresses property predication
unbound by space and time,
toiuno-wa can be used.

.ExSatiko
. *satiko-toiuno-wa uso-o tui-ta 

     Sachiko-toiuno-wa lie-acc commit-past 

     `Regarding Sachiko, she lied.'
     [96]masuoka12
. satiko-toiuno-wa uso-tuki-da 

     Sachiko-toiuno-wa lie-commiter-cop 

     `Regarding Sachiko, she is a liar.'
     (Constructed)







Remaining issue

Masuoka's characterization of toiuno-wa well captures
an aspect of this marker.
In the present work, I will discuss toiuno-wa from different perspectives
and will not go into detail about predication types.
I also aim at describing the relationships among other topic markers
such as wa and kedo/ga,
which is to be discussed below.




Kedo and gaBackSubSubKedo

Sometimes conjunctions can be used as topic markers.
The present study discusses kedo and ga preceded by a copula,
both of which correspond to `although' or `whereas' in English.
Kedo and ga are different mainly in register;
kedo can be used in both casual and formal styles,
while ga is mainly used in a formal style.
Ga in [a] and kedo in [b],
preceded by copulas,
function as topic markers in the sense that
they newly introduce topics in the beginning of a discourse or a paragraph, or
they are used to state different aspects of the current topic
koide84,takahashi99.
Intuitively,
`that issue' in [a] and `Yamada' in [b]
are considered to be newly introduced.

.
 . rei-no ken-desu-ga nantoka nari-sou-desu 

      that-gen issue-cop.plt-though whatever become-will-cop.plt 

      `Regarding that issue, (I) guess (I) figured the way out.'
 . yamada-no koto-da-kedo ano mama hot-toi-te ii-no-kana 

      Yamada-gen issue-cop that way leave-let-and good-nmlz-q 

      `Regarding Yamada, is it OK to just leave him?'
      [283]niwa06


Note that the so-called nominative ga is different from
the conjunctive ga in various ways.
For example,
the conjunctive ga does not directly follow nouns
as shown in [a];
nouns must be followed by the copula (desu) as shown in [a] and [a].
On the other hand,
the so-called case marker ga can directly follow nouns
as shown in [b].

.
 . taroo-wa sensei-desu-ga hanako-wa kangosi-desu 

      Taro-top teacher-cop.plt-though Hanako-top nurse-cop 

      `Taro is a teacher, while Hanako is a nurse.'
      (Conjunctive ga)
 . sensei-ga ki-masi-ta-yo 

      teacher-nom come-plt-past-fp 

      `The teacher has come.'
      (Nominative ga)


Also note that ga and kedo as topic markers are different from
conjunctive ga and kedo.
Conjunctive ga and kedo by definition follow clauses
instead of phrases;
on the other hand,
the topic marker ga and kedo cannot follow clauses.
Since kedo- or ga-coded NPs like rei-no ken `that issue' in [a] and yamada-no koto `yamada's issue' in [b]
appear to be the predicate of copular sentences,
there should be subjects of copular sentences.
However, no subjects can be added in sentences like .


Remaining issue

The characterization of kedo and ga as topic markers
which introduce topics well predicts the distributions of these markers.
In Chapter Particles,
I aim at capturing these markers as well as other topic particles from a unified point of view.



Zero particleBackSubSubZero

While overt particles almost always follow nouns in written Japanese,
the zero particles are ubiquitous in spoken Japanese.
All kinds of core arguments (A, S, and P) can be basically coded by the zero particles (O) as exemplified in .

. .[] Ga vs. O
	. taroo-O/ga kaet-teru-no-O/o sitte iru? 

		Taro-O/nom return-prog-O/acc know be 

		`Do (you) know that Taro is back?' (A  P)
	.[] O vs. O
	. ima kono hon-O/o yon-deru-nen 

		now this book-O/acc read-prog-par 

		`Now (I'm) reading this book.' (P)
	.[] Wa vs. O
	. kimi-O/wa dare-ga suki? 

		2sg-O/top who-nom like 

		`Who do you like?' (S)
		flushright
		[pp. 367-368, glosses modified]shibatani90
		flushright

Although I employ the symbol O for a zero particle and
use expressions like ``zero-coding'' and ``the zero particles'',
I do not claim the existence of O or the zero particles,
which are just a matter of notation and
are equivalent to ``bare NPs'' or ``NPs are not followed by any particle''.
For the sake of clarity, however,
I rather use the symbol O and express bare nouns as ``zero-coding''.
Also, I do not get involved in the discussion of whether
the zero particles are in fact zero or are simply omitted.




I assume that each production of a zero particle in everyday usage is governed by unique and complex conditions.
When somebody says ``the particle X can be replaced with O in this context,''
I consider it to mean ``the conditions of producing X and O in this context are not predictable in the current model''.

In this section, I review conditions of zero-coding proposed in the literature.
Note that other parts of BackSubSecParticles
focus on written Japanese,
while this part focuses on spoken Japanese.
shimojo06 and fry01 are useful surveys of the previous literature and
I rely on them to review the literature here.


Socio-linguistic factors

tsutsui84 points out that the zero particles are acceptable
in less formal situations.












































Also, it is reported that
the zero particles are used differently in different dialects [e.g.,][]sasaki06,nakagawa13m.






I discuss the zero particles in casual forms spoken around Tokyo
to control the effects of stylistic and dialect differences.


Word and sentence length

[98ff.]tsutsui84 also proposes that
the zero particles following monosyllabic nouns are less natural than
those following multisyllabic nouns.










[123]fry01 reports that
40 of the multisyllabic words are zero-coded,
while 27 of the monosyllabic words are zero-coded.
  
 However, his results are more complex;
 the difference between the zero-coding ratios of multisyllabic words
 and monosyllabic words are significant for As and Ss;
 but not for Ps.
 
Moreover,
[44]jorden74 has claimed that
zero-coding is frequent especially in short sentences.
[122ff.]fry01,
by comparing short utterances with less than 10 words and
long utterances with more than or equal to 10 words,
found that the zero particles appear significantly in short utterances.






Henceforth, I focus on overt vs. zero particles following multisyllabic NPs in short sentences to avoid this factor.


Contrast and narrow focus

Contrasted elements are always followed by wa [53ff.]tsutsui84.
In [a], for example,
boku `I' and biru `Bill' are contrasted,
which cannot felicitously be followed by the zero particles.

.
 . boku-wa/*O oyoi-da-kedo biru-wa/*O oyoga-nakat-ta-yo 

      1sg-top/O swim-past-though Bill-wa/O swim-neg-past-fp 

      `I swam, but Bill didn't swim.'
 . boku-wa/O biiru-wa/*O nomu-kedo sake-wa/*O noma-nai 

      1sg-wa/O beer-wa/O drink-though sake-wa/O drink-neg 

      `I drink beer but not sake.'
      (Modified from [54]tsutsui84)
       
      Many of Tsutsui's examples employ formal and polite forms
      rather than casual forms.
      Therefore, I henceforth modified all of his examples cited
      in the present study into casual forms
      to exclude the effect of formality.
      



As [93ff.]tsutsui84 has also pointed out,
the zero particles cannot felicitously be used
in the narrow-focus context
(the argument focus structure or ``exclusivity'' in Tsutsui's term),
Instead, overt particles are obligatory
(see also fujiiono00).
As shown in [B], where suteeki `steak' is focused, for example,
the overt particle o is natural,
while the zero particle O is not.

.
 .[A:] Did you eat spaghetti in the restaurant?
 .[B:] boku-wa suteeki-o/*O tabe-ta-n-da-yo 

          1sg-top steak-o/O eat-past-nmlz-fp 

          `I ate steak (not spaghetti).'
          [93, context added]tsutsui84

In a similar manner,
hon `book' in [B] can be naturally followed by ga,
but not O
because hon is narrow-focused.

.
 .[A:] Which book is interesting?
 .[B:] kono hon-ga/*O omosiroi-yo 

          this book-ga/*O interesting-fp 

          `This book is interesting.'
          (op.cit.: 94, context added)

Based on these facts,
shimojo06, following leed02,
proposes that the function of the zero particles is to
``withhold[...] reference to other referents 
which are potentially related to the proposition denoted by the sentence'' (p. 131).


On the other hand,
matsuda96 and fry01 report the tendency that
wh-word Ps (such as nani `what' and dare `who') are
more likely to be zero-coded than non-wh-word Ps.
Fry found that 71 of the wh-Ps are zero-coded,
whereas 51 of the non-wh-Ps are zero-coded.
As exemplified in ,
zero-coded wh-Ps are not rare.
  
 However, I did not find any examples of dare as P in
 the Chiba three-party conversation corpus.
 

.
 . de satosi ima nani-O si-ten-no 

      then Satoshi now what-O do-prog-q 

      `So, what are you doing now, Satoshi?'
      chiba1232: 349.08-349.98
 . nani-O turu-no 

      what-O fish-q 

      `What do you fish?'
      chiba0732: 491.59-492.07



The fact that wh-words are more likely to be zero-coded than non-wh-words contradicts Tsutsui's observation because,
in general, wh-questions are considered to be in narrow focus.
Similarly, [Chapter 10]niwa06 reports that
objects corresponding to the answer to wh-questions are acceptable,
which is also considered to be in narrow focus and
is a counter-example to Tsutsui's claim.
As shown in the example [A],
the object kootya `tea' corresponding to the answer to a wh-question can be coded by either o or O.

.
 .[Q:] Which do you wanna drink, coffee or tea?
 .[A:] zyaa kootya-o/O nomu-wa 

          then tea-o/O drink-fp 

          `Then, (I) drink tea.'
          [291]niwa06

More complicatedly,
wh-subjects can be zero-coded,
while subjects corresponding to the answer to a wh-question cannot be zero-coded niwa06.
As exemplified in ,
the wh-subject dare `who' can be either zero-coded or ga-coded,
but the subject corresponding to the answer cannot be felicitously zero-coded.

.
 . ima dare-ga/O ki-teta-no? 

       now who-ga/O come-pfv-q 

       `Who came a moment ago?'
 . taroo-ga/?O ki-teta-n-da 

       Taro-ga/O come-pfv-nmlz-cop 

       `Taro came.'
          [291]niwa06

fry03 reports that
the ratio of the zero particles coding wh-words for As and Ss (25) is lower than the ratio of zero-coding for non-wh-As and Ss (32),
although the difference is not significant in a -test.








Word order

[108ff.]tsutsui84 argues that
the zero particles can be used naturally
``if the NP [...] is preceded by the subject of the sentence and immediately followed by the predicate'' (p. 108).
As instantiated in ,
Tsutsui claims that the zero-coded NP eigo `English' in [a] is natural
because it is preceded by the subject boku `I' and immediately followed by the predicate umai `good',
while the zero-coding in [b] is unnatural because
it is not immediately followed by the predicate.

.
 . boku-wa/O hanako-yori eigo-ga/O umai-yo 

      1sg-wa/O Hanako-than English-ga/O good-fp 

      `I'm better at English than Hanako.'
 . boku-wa/O eigo-ga/??O hanako-yori umai-yo 

      1sg-wa/O English-ga/O Hanako-than good-fp 

      `I'm better at English than Hanako.'
      [110]tsutsui84

This is supported by matsuda96 and fry01.
[124]fry01, for example, found that
58 of the verb-adjacent Ps are zero-coded,
whereas 41 of the non-verb-adjacent Ps are zero-coded.

[291ff.]niwa06 points out that verb-adjacent NPs
can be more naturally zero-coded
when the NPs are non-topic (focus).
  
 There may be elements in a sentence that are
 neither topic nor focus.
 The present study, however, assumes that all core arguments are
 either topic or focus;
 therefore, if an element is not a topic,
 it is assumed that it is a focus.
 
On the other hand,
Niwa also found that clause-initial NPs can be naturally zero-coded
when the NPs are topics.
Compare and .
Sugoi kawaii ko `very cute girl' in is in focus
because the NP is indefinite and is treated as news.
In this case,
the verb-adjacent NP can be felicitously zero-coded as in [a],
whereas the non-verb-adjacent NP cannot naturally be zero-coded [b].

.
 . oi keiri-ka-ni sugoi kawaii ko-ga/O hait-ta-zo 

      hey accounting-section-dat very cute girl-ga/O enter-past-fp

      `Hey, a very cute girl joined the accounting section.'
 . oi sugoi kawaii ko-ga/?O keiri-ka-ni hait-ta-zo 

      hey very cute girl-ga/O accounting-section-dat enter-past-fp

      `Hey, a very cute girl joined the accounting section.'
      [293]niwa06

On the contrary,
ano ko `that girl' in is topical
because the NP is definite and the participants have discussed her.
In this case,
both the verb-adjacent and non-verb-adjacent NPs can be
felicitously zero-coded.

. (People have discussed a female newcomer ano ko `that girl'.)
 . oi keiri-ka-ni ano ko-ga/O hait-ta-zo 

      hey accounting-section-dat that girl-ga/O enter-past-fp

      `Hey, that girl joined the accounting section.'
 . oi ano ko-ga/O keiri-ka-ni hait-ta-zo 

      hey that girl-ga/O accounting-section-dat enter-past-fp

      `Hey, that girl joined the accounting section.'
      (ibid.)








































Types of predicates

tateishi89 argues that the zero particles are natural only inside V.
The subjects of a stage-level predicate or an unaccusative predicate can be naturally zero-coded
because they are realized inside V.
On the other hand, the subjects of an individual-level predicate or an unergative predicate
are realized outside V [see also][56--57]kageyama93.
As shown by the contrast between and ,
the subjects of unaccusative predicates can naturally be either zero- or ga-coded,
while those of unergative predicates can only be coded by ga;
zero-coding results in anomaly.

. Unaccusative predicate
 . tanaka-san-ga/O nakunat-ta-no sira-nakat-ta 

      Tanaka-hon-ga/O pass.away-past-nmlz know-neg-past 

      `(I) didn't know that Mr. Tanaka passed away.'
 . terebi-no nyuusu-de tankaa-ga/O tinbotu suru tokoro mi-ta-yo 

      TV-gen news-at tanker-ga/O sink do place see-past-fp 

      `(I) saw a tanker sinking in the TV news.'
      [56]kageyama93

. Unergative predicate
 . kodomo-tati-ga/?*O sawagu-no mi-ta koto nai 

      child-pl-ga/O mess.around-nmlz see-past thing not.exist 

      `(I've) never seen the children messing around.'
 . kanzya-ga/?*O abare-ta-no sit-te-masu-ka 

      patient-ga/O go.violent-past-nmlz know-prog-plt-q 

      `Did (you) know that the patient went violent?'
      (ibid.)


yatabe99 points out that there are counter-examples to Tateishi's generalization,
citing an example from niwa89.
The predicate happyoo suru `give a presentation' is an ergative predicate and it is possible to zero-code the agent of this action
as shown in .

. kondo gengo-gakkai-de yamada-san-ga/O happyoo suru-n-da-tte 

      next.time linguistic-conference-loc Yamada-hon-ga/O presentation do-nmlz-cop-quot 

      `I heard that Mr. Yamada is going to give a presentation in the next linguistic conference.'
      [49]niwa89

Note, however, that this example is topical zero-coding,
rather than focal zero-coding and
these two might be different from each other.

Yatabe also argues against Tateishi's claim that
zero particles cannot naturally follow
the subject of an individual-level predicate.
Although I do not get involved in this discussion
because it is outside the scope of the present study,
I suggest that this is also attributable to
the distinction between the topic vs. focus zero particles.












Types of nouns

The hierarchy of features proposed in silverstein76,silverstein81
also plays a crucial role in zero-codings of spoken Japanese.
minashima01 reports that
indefinite or inanimate objects are more likely to be zero-coded
than definite or animate objects.
The results in [128ff.]fry01 support Minashima's generalization.
  
 In Fry's data, zero-codings of animate and inanimate objects are not
 significantly different.
 He speculates that this might be because of the small number of
 animate objects in his corpus.
 
kurumadajaeger13,kurumadajaeger15, by conducting experiments on speaker's choice between overt vs. zero particles,
also report that speakers are more likely to attach the overt particle (o) to animate objects.
On the other hand,
[128ff.]fry01 reports that
``strongly definite'' subjects (proper nouns and personal pronouns)
are more likely to be zero-coded than other kinds of subjects.
Also, animate subjects are more likely to be zero-coded than
inanimate subjects.
Fry points out that this tendency follows the typological generalization
proposed in comrie79,comrie83.

niwa06 suggests that
the predictability of nouns influences the coding of particles.
Compare [a] and [b], for example.
The only difference between these two examples is what
might fall from the sky;
in [a], rain might fall,
while, in [b], hail might fall,
which is more surprising.
In [a], both the overt particle ga and the zero particle
are acceptable.
But, in [b], only the overt particle is acceptable.

. (The sky looks threatening.)
 . ame-ga/O huru-kamosirenai-n-da-tte 

      rain-ga/O fall-pot-nmlz-cop-quot 

      `I heard that it might rain.'
 . hyoo-ga/?O huru-kamosirenai-n-da-tte 

      hail-ga/O fall-pot-nmlz-cop-quot 

      `I heard that it might hail.'
      [290]niwa06

kurumadajaeger13 argues that
``Japanese speakers prefer to produce an object NP without case marking
when grammatical function of a noun is made more predictable
given the semantics of the noun (e.g., animacy) and
the other linguistic elements in the sentence
(e.g., plausibility of [grammatical-function]-assignment given the subject, object, and verb)'' (p. 863, see also kurumadajaeger15).
For example,
doctors are more likely to do something to patients,
rather than vice versa.
Therefore, the case [a] is more predictable than the case [b],
and isya in [b] is more likely to be overtly coded than
kanzya in [a].

.
 . isya-ga kanzya-o/O byoositu-de teate si-ta 

      doctor-nom patient-o/O hospital.room-in treat do-past 

      `The/a doctor treated the/a patient in a hospital room.'
 . kanzya-ga isya-o/O byoositu-de mat-ta 

      patient-nom doctor-o/O hospital.room-in wait-past 

      `The/a patient waited for the/a doctor in a hospital room.'
  .[]    (Translated from [860]kurumadajaeger13)

They argue that their study
``constitutes strong support for the view that
language production is optimized to maximize the efficiency of information transmission'',
referring to levyjaeger07 and jaeger10.












Other pragmatic factors

makinotsutsui86 and backhouse93 point out that
NPs in interrogatives tend to be zero-coded.
This is supported by fry01,
who studied a large corpus.
For example,
in from the corpus of fry01,
pen, whose existence is in question, is zero-coded.

. nanka kami-to pen-O aru? 

      um paper-and pen-O exist 

      `Um, do you have pen and paper?'
      [120]fry01

Sentences of this type have attracted particular attention
because the zero particle in this sentence is not optional;
wa and ga (and, of course, o) cannot be used in this context.
According to onoe87,
these obligatory zero particles typically appear in sentences like
the following.

.
 . kore-O oisii-yo 

      this-O good-fp 

      `This is delicious.'
 . huzi-san-O mi-eru? 

      Fuji-mountain--O see-cap 

      `Can you see Mt. Fuji? (Is Mt. Fuji visible to you?)'
 . rosia-go-O yom-eru? 

      Russia-language-O read-cap 

      `Can you read Russian? (Is Russian readable to you?)'
      [48]onoe87


Also, [118ff.]tsutsui84 observes that
the zero particles code information the hearer expects to hear.
As shown in the contrast between and ,
the zero particle (as well as ga in this case) can naturally code basu `bus' 
if the speaker and the hearer are waiting for a bus and hence
the hearer expects to hear the word basu `bus';
on the other hand,
zero-coded basu is unnatural
because the hearer does not expect to hear basu.

.
 .[] Situation: the speaker and the hearer are waiting for a bus,
       and the speaker sees the bus coming.
 .[] a basu-ga/O ki-ta 

      oh bus-ga/O come-past 

      `Oh here comes a bus.'
      [120]tsutsui84

.
 .[] Situation: the speaker sees a bus coming in a place
       where there is no bus service.
 .[] a basu-ga/*O ki-ta 

      oh bus-ga/O come-past 

      `Oh here comes a bus.'
      (ibid.)


Some researchers argue that
discourse structures affect the selection of wa vs. O.
suzuki95, analyzing casual interviews,
claims that
``relatively speaking, zero-marked phrases tend to represent
minor [discourse] boundaries in contrast to major boundaries represented
by wa-phrases'' (p. 615).
On the other hand,
kurosaki03,
investigating scenarios of TV dramas,
argues that the zero particles are employed to introduce new topics
[see also][]niwa06,
which implies that the zero particles appear at major discourse boundaries.
For now,
I suppose that it is extremely difficult to identify discourse boundaries in a reliable way,
let alone the difference between major and minor boundaries.
Therefore, we need to wait for breakthroughs in this area.


Remaining issues

As we can see from the outline of studies on the zero particles,
factors that affect zero- vs. overt-codings are complex,
and some results are contradictory.
A theory that explains zero-coding is necessary.
I propose a unified theory that predicts zero-coding in terms of
information structure
based on nakagawa13m.
Along the lines of comrie79,comrie83,
I propose a frequency account of zero- vs. overt-codings of particles.
I believe that this account is congruent with
the theory proposed in levyjaeger07,kurumadajaeger13 and kurumadajaeger15.





























































































































Word orderBackSubSecWO

While Japanese basic word order is APV (or SOV in more popular terminology),
other variations are also possible.
Example [a] shows the basic word order, and
examples [b--f] show other possibilities.
According to [260]shibatani90,
not all possibilities are equally natural in out-of-the-blue contexts,
as shown by `?' before the sentence.

.
 . taroo-ga hanako-ni sono hon-o yat-ta 

      Taro-nom Hanako-dat that book-acc give-past 

      `Taro gave a book to Hanako.' (A + DAT + P + V)
 . hanako-ni taroo-ga sono hon-o yat-ta 

      Hanako-dat Taro-nom that book-acc give-past 

      (DAT + A + P + V)
 . sono hon-o taroo-ga hanako-ni yat-ta 

      that book-acc Taro-nom Hanako-dat give-past 

      (P + A + DAT + V)
 . taroo-ga sono hon-o hanako-ni yat-ta 

      Taro-nom that book-acc Hanako-dat give-past 

      (A + P + DAT + V)
 . ?hanako-ni sono hon-o taroo-ga yat-ta

      (DAT + P + A + V)
 . ?sono hon-o hanako-ni taroo-ga yat-ta 

      that book-acc Hanako-dat  Taro-nom give-past 

      (P + DAT + A + V)
 .[] [260]shibatani90

In spoken Japanese,
NPs (and adverbs) sometimes appear post-predicatively as exemplified in [b].

.
 . taroo-ga ki-ta 

      Taro-nom come-past 

      `Taro came.' (S + V)
 . ki-ta-yo taroo-ga 

      come-past-fp Taro-nom 

      `Lit. Came, Taro.' (V + S)
 .[] [258--259]shibatani90



Different theories are interested in different aspects of word order phenomena in Japanese.
Generative linguists and psycholinguists, as far as I can see, are mainly interested in `scrambling':
word order variations of subjects, objects, datives, and possibly other arguments,
all of which appear before the predicates.
More recently, generative linguists have also been interested in `left periphery',
which is tightly connected with information structure.
Some construction grammarians study dative-alternation-like phenomena in Japanese.
  
 I do not discuss the dative alternation in this study.
 See nakamotoetal06,
 who found that a choice between DAT+P+V and P+DAT+V is determined
 by the meaning of a sentence as a whole.
 More specifically, they showed that P+DAT+V is preferred for caused motion.
 On the other hand, their results also show that
 ``there is an overall tendency for Japanese speakers to prefer [DAT+P+V] order to [P+DAT+V]'' (p. 1).
 They argue that ``the strength of the preference is not constant among different supralexical meanings '' (ibid.).
 
Functional linguists and, more recently, interactional linguists are interested in post-predicate constructions,
partially because they are mainly working on spoken language,
and post-predicate constructions in Japanese only appear in spoken language.
On the other hand,
traditional Japanese linguists have not discussed the word order phenomena
that I am interested in (except for noda83).
Instead of word order variations, they concentrate on affix ordering and dependency relations (see e.g., saeki98).

I outline previous studies on basic word order and other variations in the following sections.
Note that different approaches are skewed to different sections
for the reasons stated above.




Basic word order

As far as I can tell,
all the Japanese linguists agree that
the basic word order in Japanese is SOV (APV in terms of this study).
For example,
shibatani90 states that
``Japanese is an `ideal' SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language
in the sense that the word order of `dependent-head' is consistently maintained with regard to all types of constituent'' (p. 257).

.
 . taroo-ga ki-ta 

      Taro-nom come-past 

      `Taro came.' (S + V)
 . taroo-wa ki-ta-ka 

      Taro-top come-past-q 

      `Did Taro come?'  (S (Topic) + V)
 . taroo-ga hon-o kat-ta 

      Taro-nom book-acc buy-past 

      `Taro bought a book.' (A + P + V)
 . taroo-ga hanako-ni hon-o yat-ta 

      Taro-nom Hanako-dat book-acc give-past 

      `Taro gave a book to Hanako.' (A + DAT + P + V)
 . taroo-ga nani-o kat-ta-ka sira-nai 

      Taro-nom what-acc buy-past-q know-neg 

      `(I) don't know what Taro bought.'  (Clause + V)
 .[]     [257--258]shibatani90


chujo83 conducted a sentence-comprehension experiment and
reports that it takes longer to judge the grammaticality of PAV order than APV order.
  
 There is one exceptional case;
 if P is human and is not followed by the particle o,
 the time difference between APV and PAV disappears.
 
It is also confirmed that
the order PAV is more difficult to process than the basic order APV
in other experiments such as
phrase-by-phrase reading tasks miyamototakahashi02,
eye-movement experiments mazukaetal02, and
ERP experiments uenokluender03.


In my data from the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese,
which is to be explained in the next chapter,
39 examples appear in APV order,
whereas 9 examples appear in PAV order.
Therefore, APV is the basic (most frequent) word order in the corpus.
  
 Other non-verb-final orders such as VAP or AVP are extremely rare.
 
Note, however, that
these numbers are very small compared to
examples where a single full NP appears in a clause;
644 examples appear in the SV order,
336 examples appear in the PV order (without A), and
526 examples appear in the DAT + V order.
  
 However, the AV pattern appears only in 8 examples.
 
Infrequency of two or more full NPs within the same clause
has already been reported in Japanese matsumoto03 and other languages dubois87,dryer97,
which is also supported in my data.





Clause-initial elements

Although NPs that appear clause-initially can also be called
``preposed'' or ``scrambled'' NPs,
I call them clause-initial NPs
because terms like ``preposing'' and ``scrambling'' assume
the movement of NPs.
Some even call all clause-initial NPs ``topicalized'' NPs,
but I do not employ this term either because
the term already attributes a special function to the clause-initial NPs.
On the other hand, the term ``clause-initial'' does not assume movements
nor any functions of clause-initial NPs.


Topic

Functional linguists and recent generative grammarians who are working on cartography agree that topic-like NPs appear clause initially.
As has traditionally been pointed out,
topics, which correlate with given information,
tend to appear clause-initially
mathesius28,firbas64,danes70,kuno78.
These topics function as ``anchors''
that associates the previous and up-coming utterances.
Generative grammarians [e.g.,][]endo14 assume the universal hierarchy proposed in rizzi04
and argue that Japanese also follows this hierarchy.
In generative grammar,
it is assumed that a language (structure) is uniform
unless there is strong counter-evidence
[the Uniformity Principle:][2]chomsky01.

 . Force Top* Int Top* Focus Mod* Top* Fin IP
    [242]rizzi04

``Force'' stands for clause types such as declarative, interrogative, and imperative;
``Top'' for topic,
``Int'' for higher wh-elements rizzi01;
``Mod'' for modifier such as adverbs; and
``Fin'' for finiteness.


ferreirayoshita03 conducted a production experiment and found that
Japanese speakers produced given arguments before new arguments,
especially ``when the previous mention of the given argument involved the same lexical content'' (p. 688).
imamura17 employed the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ) and concludes that
``the direct objects in OSV [non-canonical ``scrambled'' word order] and wa-marked entities are generally given information.
Yet, word order changes from SOV [canonical word order] to OSV do not influence the cataphoric prominence of a referent'' (p. 78).



Weight

Another important factor that affects word order is the weight of NP.
yamashitachang01 pointed out that
in Japanese,
heavy NPs tend to precede light NPs,
whereas, in SVO languages like English,
light NPs are reported to precede heavy NPs [e.g.,][]arnoldetal00.
They also report that topics and subjects tend to precede other NPs
and the weight and topichood of a NP competes to decide the order of NPs [see also][]kondoyamashita07.



Remaining issue

The previous literature agrees that topics,
correlating with given information, appear clause-initially.
This is also motivated from a cognitive perspective.
The results of Chapter WordOrder, however, show that
not all given elements appear clause-initially.
Moreover, there are post-predicate elements which correspond to topics in Japanese.
It is therefore also necessary to explain why some topics appear after the predicate.
In Chapter WordOrder,
I will show that sharedness,
rather than givenness in general,
affects word order in Japanese and that
activation status determines whether
NPs appear clause-initially or post-predicatively.
Also, whether the referent in question is mentioned in the following discourse or not affects word order in addition to the effect of particles,
contrary to the finding of imamura17.


Post-predicate elementsBack:CharJ:WO:PostP

I call NPs that appear after the predicate post-predicate or postposed NPs.
As has been stated earlier,
they appear mainly in the spoken language.
Whereas adverbs and noun-modifying phrases are also postposed frequently in conversation,
the present study only discusses postposed NPs,
which are exemplified in .

.
 . yurusite kun-nai-yo syatyoo-ga 

      allow give-neg-fp president-nom 

      `(He) would not allow (us to do such a thing), the president.'
      [431]onosuzuki92
 . omosiroi-kamo haikei-ga 

      interesting-may.be background-nom 

      `It's interesting, the background.'
      [9]nakagawaetal08_paper



Afterthoughts

Some researchers consider postposed elements to be ``afterthoughts'' [259]shibatani90:
a clarification for an omitted element.
kuno78,hinds82 and onosuzuki92 also make a similar point.
However,
it has been pointed out that
some postposed elements are produced in a coherent intonation contour without pause ([436]onosuzuki92; [2]ono07),
which suggests the possibility that
the speaker does not have time to plan to produce the postposed part;
rather, the postposed part has been planned as such.





Non-focus

takami95b,
modifying kuno78,
proposes that non-focus NPs can be postposed.
When the focus NPs are postposed,
the sentences are not acceptable,
as shown in ,
where the wh-word nani `what' in [a] and
mizu `water' in [b] are considered to be foci.

.




 . *ato iti-nen-de teinen-nan-desu-ka dare-ga 

      remaining one-year-within retiring-cop-plt-q who-nom 

      `Is (he) going to retire within a year, who?'
      [160]takami95b      
 . ??boku-wa nomi-tai mizu-ga 

      1sg-top drink-want water-nom 

      `I want to drink, water.'
      (op.cit.: p. 161)

takami95a argues that
the NPs in the following examples can be postposed because
they are not the most important information,
although they are part of focus.

.
 . akegata yatto umare-masi-ta otoko-no ko-ga 

      dawn finally born-plt-past male-gen child-nom 

      `At dawn, (he) was finally born, a male baby.'
 . taroo-wa hanako-ni katte yat-ta-yo zyuk-karatto-no daiya-no yubiwa-o 

      Taro-top Hanako-dat buy give-past-fp 10-carat-gen diamond-gen ring-acc 

      `Taro gave Hanako, a 10-carat diamond ring.'
      [236]takami95a

I suppose that Takami's important information is equal to focus.
In , part of the focus is postposed,
but it is not ``the most focalized part'';
so the sentences in are acceptable.
Therefore,
Takami's generalization that foci (or the most focalized part) cannot be postposed still holds.

fujii91 argues that pragmatically important parts (such as focus and contrast) are uttered first,
which results in postposed constructions.
I consider this argument to be similar to Takami's argument and
include Fujii in this section of postposed elements as non-focus.



Emphasis

hinds82 argues that some postposed elements add emphasis to the utterance.
[437]onosuzuki92 also point out postposed elements that
``strengthen the speaker's stance toward the proposition.''





Although it is not clear how to identify ``emphasis'',
their argument is important at least in two ways.
First,
when the postposed elements are produced in a coherent contour with the predicate,
they are similar to final particles such as ne and yo.
For example, in ,
the postposed element watasi `I' follows the final particle yo.

. sukii itte ki-masi-ta-yo watasi 

      ski go come-plt-past-fp 1sg 

      `(I) went skiing, me.'
      [438]onosuzuki92

Given that final particles can appear in a row (e.g., oisii yo ne `good, isn't it?'),
it is no wonder that postposed elements behave like final particles
and add some kind of the speaker's attitude toward the proposition like final particles.

Second,
as onosuzuki92 pointed out,
the implicatures of some postposed construction are dramatically different from the corresponding pre-predicate constructions.

For example, compare [a] and [b].
They are composed of exactly the same elements;
only the orders are different.
In [a], sore `that' is postposed;
in [b], sore is in the basic position.
Therefore, they are expected to convey exactly the same meaning.
However, [a] is not a simple question;
rather it is closer to a rhetorical question implying that the speaker doesn't like sore.
On the other hand, [b] is a simple neutral question.

.
 . nani sore 

      what that 

      `What!?'
      (op.cit.: p. 440)
 . sore nani 

       that what 

       `What's that?'


Based on the evidence discussed above,
ono07 claims that the postposed construction has already been grammaticalized and is part of Japanese grammar.



Activation cost

nakagawaetal08_paper divided postposed NPs into two types
based on intonation,
following onosuzuki92:
the postposed element uttered within the same intonation contour with the predicate (single-contour type) and
that uttered separately from the predicate (double-contour type).
They measured the Referential Distance (RD) between the postposed element in question and and its immediate antecedent by inter-pausal unit.
The RD approximates the activation cost of the referent.
A smaller RD indicates that the referent has been previously mentioned relatively recently and hence the activation cost is low;
a larger RD indicates that it has been previously mentioned less recently
and hence the activation cost is high.

Nakagawa et al. found that
the RD of the single-contour type is much smaller than that of the double-contour type.
They argue that the activation cost of the single-contour type is small
and the referent is discussed currently as a topic.
On the other hand, they report that the double-contour type is contributed by multiple factors.



Preferred interactional structure

tanaka05 argues that
interactional factors affect word order in Japanese conversation.
In sequences of conversation,
there are preferred and dispreferred organizations schegloffetal77,heritage84,pomerantz84.
Preferred organizations are, for example,
an assessment followed by agreement and a request followed by acceptance.
On the other hand,
dispreferred organizations include
an assessment followed by disagreement and a request followed by refusal.
Preferred second parts such as agreement to an assessment and acceptance to a request are simple, direct, and are uttered without delay.
On the other hand,
dispreferred second parts such as disagreement to an assessment and a refusal to a request are complex, indirect, and are uttered with delay.
[332ff.]levinson83 compares preferred vs. dispreferred organizations to unmarkedness vs. markedness in morphology.

Based on this argument,
tanaka05 found that the preferred second part begins with the predicate, followed by NPs (and other adverbs and adverbial clauses),
while the dispreferred second part ends with the predicate,
preceded by NPs (and other elements).
Tanaka argues that this contrast is observed because
the predicate expresses the conclusion such as agreement, disagreement, acceptance, and refusal.

Let us take a closer look at the following example of an assessment-agreement sequence.
In ,
Chikako (C), Keiko (K), and Emiko (E) are talking about current fashion trends, which have been revived from their youth.
First, Chikako comments that the current fashion is exactly the same as the fashion trends of their youth.
Then Keiko immediately agrees with Chikako
by uttering the predicate followed by an NP.
Note that the sign ``='' indicates that there is no pause between utterances.

.
 .[C:] ima-no katati-to mattaku onnazi.= 

                now-gen form-com exactly same 

                `(It's) exactly the same shape as the ones in vogue now.'
 .[K:] =onnazi-yo =[eri-mo 

          same-fp collar-also 

          `(It's) the same, the collar too.'
 .[E:]  [a! honto::. 

           oh really 

          `Oh re::ally.'
          [406]tanaka05

On the other hand, in the next example of a dispreferred second part,
the speaker delays the predicate expressing refusal
by putting a lot of NPs and adverbs before the predicate.
Before the second part ,
  
 I modified the transcription symbol ``- (hyphen)'' to `` (tilde)'' because hyphens are used to express morphological boundaries in this study.
 The tilde (originally, a hyphen) indicates a sudden stop of an utterance (typically a word) on the way to utter it.
 I will not explain other transcription symbols here because
 they are irrelevant to the current discussion.
 For more detail on transcription symbols,
 see jefferson04 and hepburnbolden13.
 
the speaker was asked about the content of an advertisement in a magazine.

.
 . sono nakami-made tyotto-ne 

      its content-even a.bit-fp 

      `When it comes down to its contents, sort of...'
 . kookoku-no gn ga-tte-no-wa tyotto 

      advert-gen df nom-quot-nmlz-top a.bit 

      `when it comes to (the content) of the advert, sort of...'
 . kotira-de-wa 

      here-loc-top 

      `on our side...'
 . wakara-nai-n-desu-keredomo, .hhhh 

      know-neg-nmlz-plt-though 

      `(we) have no knowledge of.'
      (op.cit.: 413)

The speaker could have simply said ``we have no knowledge of (it)''
because all other NPs are clear from the context.
However, the speaker chose to utter NPs (and adverbs) instead of omitting them presumably to delay the conclusion.


Remaining issue

Postposed constructions are well studied in various theories.
However, few studies examine the difference between postposed NPs and
other NPs such as clause-initial and pre-predicate NPs.
tanaka05 does not explain why speakers sometimes produce
post-predicate elements and sometimes not.
In Chapter WordOrder,
I will investigate these three kinds of NPs in terms of information structure,
especially activation cost.
Also, I will discuss the possible raison d'etre of post-predicate elements.




Pre-predicate elements

I call NPs that appear immediately before the predicate pre-predicate elements.
The discussion of the basic word order implies that
Ps most frequently appear pre-predicatively and that this is the basic order.
Therefore,
I assume that almost all theories assume that Ps appear pre-predicatively as basic word order and
I provide a review of other characteristics of NPs that appear pre-predicatively.



Unaccusativity

Since perlmutter78,
it is widely assumed that there are two types of intransitive verbs:
unergative verbs, which involve an agent, and
unaccusative verbs, which involve only a patient (theme).
Especially among generative linguists,
it is also assumed that the argument of an unergative verb syntactically appears in the same position as the subject (A) of transitive clauses,
while the argument of an unaccusative verb appears in the same position as the object (P) of transitive clauses.
kageyama93, who applied this idea to Japanese,
provides rich examples to support this analysis of the surface structures of Japanese sentences.
As can be seen in examples to ExKageyamaUnacc,
the argument of an unergative verb otoko-no ko `boy' in appears in the same position as the subject (A) of a transitive verb kodomo `child' in ,
whereas the argument of an unaccusative verb ki-no eda `tree branch' in ExKageyamaUnacc appears in the same position as the object (P) of a transitive verb ki-no eda in .

. Transitive verb
 . kodomo-ga ki-no eda-o ot-ta 

      child-nom tree-gen branch-acc break-past 

      `A child broke a tree branch.'
 . [.VP [.NP kodomo-ga ] [.V ki-no eda-o.NP [.V ot-ta ] ] ]
  [46]kageyama93

.ExKageyamaUner Intransitive (Unergative) verb
 . otoko-no ko-ga abare-ta 

      male-gen child-nom go.violent-past 

      `A boy went violent.'
 . [.VP otoko-no ko-ga.NP [.V [.V abare-ta ] ] ]
 (ibid.)

.ExKageyamaUnacc Intransitive (Unaccusative) verb
 . ki-no eda-ga ore-ta 

      tree-gen branch-nom break-past 

      `A tree branch broke.'
 . [.VP [.NP ] [.V ki-no eda.NP ] [.V ore-ta ] ]
 (ibid.)

The important point for our interest is that
the argument of unaccusative verbs and the object (P) of transitive verbs
structurally appear closer to the verb;
i.e., they appear pre-predicatively since Japanese is basically a verb-final language.



Focus

kuno78 and takami95a point out that
pre-predicate elements are focus (``most important information'').
[4.2.]endo14 also states that foci appear pre-predicatively.
Compare the following examples.
In [A],
where `Boston' appears pre-predicatively preceded by `Hanako',
responding only to Boston is felicitous as in [A],
while responding only to Hanako is not as in [A].

.
 .[Q:] ziroo-wa hanako-to bosuton-ni it-ta? 

         Jiro-top Hanako-with Boston-dat go-past 

         `Did Jiro go to Boston with Hanako?'
 .[A:] un bosuton-ni it-ta-yo 

           yeah Boston-dat go-past-fp 

           `Yeah, I went to Boston.'
 .[A:] *un hanako-to it-ta-yo 

           yeah Hanako-with go-past-fp 

           `Yeah, I went with Hanako.'
           [52]kuno78

In ,
on the other hand,
where `Hanako' appears pre-predicatively preceded by `Boston',
responding only to Hanako is a natural answer as in [A],
while responding only to Boston is not as in [A].

.
 .[Q:] ziroo-wa bosuton-ni hanako-to it-ta? 

         Jiro-top Boston-dat Hanako-with go-past 

         `Did Jiro go to Boston with Hanako?'
 .[A:] *un bosuton-ni it-ta-yo 

           yeah Boston-dat go-past-fp 

           `Yeah, I went to Boston.'
 .[A:] un hanako-to it-ta-yo 

           yeah Hanako-with go-past-fp 

           `Yeah, I went with Hanako.'
           [54]kuno78

This implies that focus appears pre-predicatively.
The results reported in Chapter WordOrder basically support this observation.


Remaining issue

The observations discussed in the literature above imply that
Ps, the arguments of the unaccusative verbs, and foci appear pre-predicatively.
The results in Chapter WordOrder show that both patienthood and newness contribute to word order in Japanese.
The next question is what kind of theory allows both patient and new elements to appear pre-predicatively.
Throughout this study,
I aim at showing the plausibility of the theory that captures multiple variables at the same time, i.e., the theory of competing motivations dubois85.




IntonationBackSubIntonation

I employ the term intonation and prosody roughly in the same way.
Here I outline studies on associations between intonation and some functions including information structure.
For detailed phonetic descriptions and analyses of Japanese intonation,
see beckmanpierrehumbert84,pierrehumbertbeckman88,sugito94ed,venditti00,igarashietal06,igarashi15.

Also, I only discuss a unit smaller than a clause;
I do not discuss discourse structure
although there are many interesting interactions between intonation and discourse structure [e.g.,][]nakajimaallen93,vendittiswerts96,muraiyamashita99,koisoetal03,okuboetal03,koisoishimoto12.
I focus on 


studies on intonation units and information structure.





















































Definition of intonation unit

Before reviewing the previous literature,
I briefly discuss how an intonation unit is defined.
The definition of an intonation unit makes use of a labeling system for Japanese prosodic information called X-JToBI,
which has already been annotated in the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese.
I discuss X-JToBI in the following paragraph, then I will introduce intonation units.


X-JToBI and intonational phrases

X-JToBI maekawaetal02,igarashietal06 is based on J-ToBI proposed in venditti97,venditti00,
which itself is modified from ToBI (Tones and Break Indices), a labeling system for English prosody silvermanetal92,pitrellietal94,beckmanelam97.


Here I mainly discuss the break indices (BI) tier of X-JToBI
since this is the most relevant feature for intonation units.
The BI labelings are determined by human annotators and represent the strength of prosodic boundaries maekawaetal02,igarashietal06.
BI labelings basically consist of 1, 2, and 3.
	 
	In addition, there are diacritics m, -, p.
	There are also labels for disfluency;
	word fragments, fillers, and so on.
	See igarashietal06 for detailed description.
	
1 corresponds to a word boundary,
2 corresponds to an accentual-phrase boundary, and
3 corresponds to an intonational-phrase boundary.
An intonational phrase consists of more than or equal to one accentual phrase.
An accentual phrase consists of a pitch contour with a single F peak.
Intonational-phrase boundaries are the place where a pitch reset occurs;
if the pitch range of the current accentual phrase is smaller than the next accentual phrase,
an intonational-phrase boundary is identified in the current accentual-phrase boundary.

I introduce an example of an intonational-phrase boundary (the label 3),
which is the most relevant to our study.
Figure BIexF shows the pitch contour of the utterance .

. aoi yane-no ie-ga mieru 

	blue roof-gen house-nom visible 

	`A house with the blue roof is visible.'

The vertical lines in the figure across the pitch contour indicate
the peak and the bottom of F.
A contour with a single pitch peak corresponds to a single accentual phrase.
Comparing the first (aoi `blue') and the second (yane-no `roof-gen') accentual phrases,
the pitch range of the second accentual phrase is smaller than the first one;
i.e., downstepping occurs in the second accentual phrase.
Downstepping, a.k.a. catathesis, is ``a phonological process by which the [pitch] range is compressed after a lexical accent'' ([17]venditti00, see poser84,beckmanpierrehumbert84,pierrehumbertbeckman88,kubozono93).


In Figure BIexF, the first accentual-phrase boundary is not an intonational-phase boundary.
On the other hand,
comparing the second (yane-no `roof-gen') and the third (ie-ga `house-nom') accentual phrases,
the second pitch range is smaller than the third one.
Therefore,
the second accentual-phrase boundary is an intonational-phrase boundary.

Intonation unit

Based on X-JToBI,
denetal10 and denetal11 propose the definition of intonation unit,
which I will employ in this study.
They call it short utterance-unit as opposed to long utterance-unit,
but I use the term ``intonation unit (IU)'' throughout
since I do not discuss long utterance-units.
An intonation-unit boundary is identified
where there is an intonational phrase (the boundary labelled as 3 in CSJ) discussed above,
a clause boundary,
	 
	To be more precise, this is a long utterance-unit boundary.
	See denetal11 for the definition of this unit.
	
or
a pause equal to or more than 0.1 seconds.
As discussed in enomotoetal04,
it is difficult for human annotators to agree in deciding intonation-unit boundaries based on the system proposed in duboisetal92 and iwasaki08.
Den and his colleagues made it possible to identify intonation units in spontaneous speech consistently across annotators.

In the following section, however,
I review studies on various kinds of intonation units including those of duboisetal92,maekawaetal02,iwasaki08,denetal11.
Also, whereas prominence marking, down-stepping, and boundary pitch movements are more popular topics than intonation units,
I review those studies in relation to the current study.
See vendittietal08 for an overview of such studies.


























Intonation units and related phenomena

In this section,
I present a review of the literature on the association between prosodic units and related characteristics of language.
Note again that
the review includes various kinds of prosodic units
based on slightly different definitions,
although they agree in many cases.


Prominence and downstepping

Prominence and downstepping are crucial features in determining intonation units.
It is well known that
a focus receives prominence (pitch peak).
[99--101]pierrehumbertbeckman88 report that
``sequences with focus on the noun almost always had an intermediate phrase [i.e., intonational phrase] boundary between the adjective and the noun[...] an intermediate phrase boundary blocks catathesis [i.e., downstepping]'',
through production experiments,
where subjects were asked to produce a sequence of an adjective and a noun with different focus positions.
Target sentences and contexts Pierrehumbert and Beckman used are like the one in .
The capital letters indicate that those words are in focus, and
the bold-faced letters indicate that they are the targets of analysis.








.
 .[Q:] [In America,] are there sweet beans or carrots like there are in Japan?
 .[A:] amai NINZIN-wa ari-masu-ga amai MAME-wa ari-mase-n 

          sweet carrot-top exist-plt-though sweet bean-top exist-plt-neg 

      `There are sweet CARROTS, but there aren't sweet BEANS.'
 .[]   [59]pierrehumbertbeckman88

Pierrehumbert and Beckman showed that
there is an intonational phrase (i.e., intermediate phrase) boundary
between the adjective (amai `sweet' in [A]) and the noun (mame `bean' in [b])
when the noun is focused as in .
Although the results are complicated,
they conclude that their generalization applies to both accented and unaccented words.
  
 kubozono07 compared two definitions of downstepping (syntagmatic and paradigmatic) and investigated whether a pitch reset occurs before the focus.
 He found conflicting results;
 from a syntagmatic perspective, the focus receives higher pitch than the preceding phrase, which indicates that downstepping is blocked.
 From a paradigmatic perspective, on the other hand,
 he had to conclude that downstepping is not blocked before the focus.
 The present study employs the definition of syntagmatic downstepping
 and assumes that the conclusions in pierrehumbertbeckman88 and kubozono07 do not contradict each other.
 See kubozono07 for detailed discussion on this issue.
 






Focus projection

There has been a cross-linguistic question of how
human beings distinguish broad focus and narrow focus:
the issue of focus projection.
This has been investigated based on English, German and Dutch
selkirk84,gussenhoven83.
ito02, who investigated this question in Japanese,
compared the response time and acceptability of each of the intonation types in [A1-A3]
followed by a broad focus question like [Q].
The capital letters indicate the phrases whose pitch range is expanded.
.
 .[Q:] yokoyama-kun-wa boonasu morat-tara doo suru-no 

          Yokoyama-hon-top bonus get-cond how do-q 

          `What will Mr.Yokoyama do when he gets a bonus?'
 .[A1:] kare-wa DAIBINGU-o HAZIMERU-n-da-yo 

           3sg-top diving-acc begin-nmlz-cop-fp 

           `He starts (scuba) diving.'
 .[A2:] kare-wa DAIBINGU-o hazimeru-n-da-yo 

           3sg-top diving-acc begin-nmlz-cop-fp 

           `He starts (scuba) diving.'
 .[A3:] kare-wa daibingu-o HAZIMERU-n-da-yo 

           3sg-top diving-acc begin-nmlz-cop-fp 

           `He starts (scuba) diving.'







      [412]ito02

Ito found that
``though dual prominence [like [A1]] is preferred for answers to broad focus questions,
utterances with a single intonational prominence on the object [like [A2]] may be comprehended equally quickly as those with dual prominence'' (op.cit.: 413),
whereas A1 is significantly more acceptable than A2.
Also, she reports that the response time and acceptability of the A3-type do not significantly differ from those of A1 and A2.
She concluded that
``it is possible that the relation between argument structure and intonational focus marking is not universal'' (ibid.).




kori11 investigated intonation of broad and narrow focus and
reports that, by default,
only the first word receives pitch peak and the following word is
suppressed,
although some speakers put prominence on the second word too.
[a] is the target sentence that he asked participants to read aloud
and [b-c] are contexts.
In [b-c], both aoi `blue' and mahuraa `scarf' are focused
because both of them contrast with `red' and `gloves' or `sweater', respectively.
In [d], aoi `blue' is narrowly focused
because only aoi `blue' contrasts with `red' and
`scarf' is not contrasted.

.
 . aoi mahuraa-dat-ta-n-desu 

      blue scarf-cop-past-nmlz-cop.plt 

      `(It) was a blue scarf.'
 . I ordered red gloves, but I received a blue scarf. (Broad focus)
 . I ordered a red sweater, but I received a blue scarf.(Broad focus)
 . I ordered a red scarf, but I received a blue scarf. (Narrow focus)

Kori concludes that
the default intonation for broad focus is to suppress the second word (mahuraa `scarf' in this case)
because most of the participants produced the sentences as such,
although some participants chose the sentence with prominence both on aoi `blue' and mahuraa `scarf'
when they were asked to choose a good sentence.






























































Functional and cognitive motivations for intonation units

iwasaki93,
applying the style of IU identification proposed in duboisetal92 and chafe94  to Japanese,
argues that a Japanese intonation unit corresponds to a phrase rather than a clause,
while chafe87,chafe94 reports that an English IU often corresponds to a clause.
According to Iwasaki's survey,
clausal IUs in Japanese are 42.2,
whereas phrasal IUs are 57.8.
Their intonation unit is a ``stretch of speech uttered under a single coherent intonation contour'' [17]duboisetal92.
[39]iwasaki93 states that
the beginning of an IU ``is often, though not always, marked by a pause, hesitation noises, and/or resetting of the baseline pitch level'',
whereas the ending of an IU ``is often, again though not always, marked by a lengthening of the last syllable.''
iwasaki93 provides as an example of intonation units in Japanese corresponding to a phrase.
Each line in corresponds to a single intonation unit
and [a-e] as a whole consist of a single proposition
``I heard that broadcast at home with my family.''

.
 . atasi-wa-ne:* 

      1sg-top-fp 

      `I, you know...'
 . uti-de kii-ta-no-ne? 

      home-loc hear-past-nmlz-fp 

      `heard at home, you know...'
 . sono are-wa-ne? 

      that that-top-fp 

      `that thing, you know...'
 . hoosoo-wa-ne? 

      broadcast-top-fp 

      `that broadcast, you know,'
 . kazoku-de. 

      family-with 

      `with my family.'
 [40]iwasaki93

The pitch and intensity of are shown in Figure IUExF from
[109]iwasaki08,
where he explains the same example with the figure.
The IU [a] ends with a final vowel lengthening,
whereas boundary pitch movements are observed in the ending of IUs [b-d],
which are indicated by ``?''.
[e] ends with a final lowering, indicated by ``.''.

Iwasaki divided the kinds of ``functional components'' into four types.

.
 Four functional components
 . Lead (LD) such as fillers, which have no substantial meaning
 . Ideation (ID), which conveys the content of speech
 . Cohesion (CO) such as conjunctives and wa, which relates the previous and the current IUs
 . Interaction (IT) such as ne `fp' and yo `fp', which is associated with communication

Based on this,
he showed the similarities among IUs.
For example, 
[a] is an IU which only contains an NP followed by particles, and
[b] is an IU which only contains a VP also followed by particles.

The structures of these two IUs are essentially the same in terms of functional components,
although they are different in terms of grammatical structure.

.
 .
  [mami-ni-dake] [-wa] [-ne] 

        Mami-dat-only -top -fp 

        ID CO IT 

 .
  [ik-ase-ta-rasii] [-no] [-yo] 

         go-caus-rep -nmlz -fp 

         ID CO IT 

  `(I heard that she) let only Mami go.'






















Iwasaki analyzed his data based on his classification and
found that more than 80 of the IUs consist of
two or less functional components.
He states that
``this might be due to the limitation of work that the speaker can handle within one IU. [...] Japanese speakers [...] are faced with a constraint which permits them to exercise up to two functions per intonation unit'' (p. 49).

On the contrary, [68]matsumoto00 reports that
``one clause comprises an average of 1.2 IUs''
and argues that
``the clause is the syntactic exponent of Japanese substantive IU''.
Instead, she proposes the ``one new NP per IU'' constraint in Japanese,
comparing it to the one new idea at a time constraint in chafe87,chafe94.
However, [5.6]matsumoto03 also reports that
one new or given NP per IU is preferred in Japanese conversation.
Therefore,
new as well as given NPs appear in an intonation unit
without other NPs.











nakagawaetal10_piu focused on the difference between
phrasal IUs and clausal IUs and
analyzed them in terms of information structure.
They measured referential distance and persistence givon83 and concluded that
one of the functions of phrasal IUs is to introduce or re-introduce
important topics in discourse.
They compare this function of phrasal IUs to left-dislocations observed in many languages.










Remaining issues

Most studies on phonetics and phonology concentrate on
foci rather than topics.
Among foci, most of the studies (except for those on focus projection) concentrate on narrow focus rather than broad focus.
Moreover, almost all of them are experimental studies rather than
corpus studies.
On the other hand, I focus here on
the difference between broad foci and topics in spontaneous speech,
although I also employ a production experiment.

Functionalists such as iwasaki93,matsumoto00,matsumoto03 and nakagawaetal10_piu
have methodological issues since they rely on the impressionistic definition of intonation units.
This study, on the contrary, is based on
strict definitions of intonation units and
aims at revealing associations between intonation and information structure.

The results in Chapter Intonation show that
an intonation unit corresponds to a unit of information structure such as topic and focus,
which frequently but not always overlaps with a unit of syntactic structure.


Pause

sugito94 showed that
pauses appear before pitch reset by means of a perceptual experiment.
She recorded trained announcers reading news and had subjects listen to the recording.
She found that, when pauses were eliminated,
subjects perceive the voice as though two people were overlapping with each other where there are pitch resets and there are supposed to be pauses.
According to her,
it is in fact impossible to reset pitch without pauses and
vocal cords are tensed 0.1 seconds before speech production.
Therefore, I assume that pauses correlate with pitch reset.



Summary

In this chapter,
I outlined the previous literature on topics and foci, and
the characteristics of Japanese related to this study,
and enumerated the remaining questions to be investigated.

In Chapters from Particles to Intonation,
I investigate the associations between information structure and particles, word order, and intonation in spoken Japanese.
Before this,
I introduce the framework this study employs in the next chapter.





FrameworkFramework








IntroductionFrameworkIntro

In this chapter I describe the framework I employ here.
First, in FrameworkSemanticMap,
I introduce the theory of conceptual space assumed throughout.
Then, I define the concepts of 'topic' and 'focus' I adopt, as well as describe the features
which have been proposed to be associated with information structure phenomena (FrameworkDefinition).
Finally,
FrameworkTFIdent explains the characteristics of the corpus to be investigated and how to annotate features correlating with topic and focus.

To investigate cognitive motivations of some linguistic category (e.g., topic and focus),
it is possible to use a variety of clues such as generalizations about typological tendencies, models of language processing, theories of language change and language contact, language acquisition process, and language production data, as well as traditional grammaticality and acceptability judgements of sentences.

This study mainly employs language production data (a.k.a. corpora) and
the acceptability of sentences
because these two directly reflect the intuition and cognition of adult native speakers of Japanese.
Sometimes I also use production experiments to obtain enough data
under controlled contexts.
It is necessary to investigate other kinds of clues such as typological tendencies, language processing models, and language acquisition processes of many other languages
to reveal how cognition is reflected in human language in general.
I hope that this study contributes to this larger goal.

This study restricts itself to investigating only standard Japanese,
since large spoken corpora are available in this language.

There are few empirical studies on information structure in spoken Japanese,
while there are at least preliminary empirical studies in other languages, such as some European languages and languages in Africa [e.g.,][]cowles03,dipperetal04,dipperetal07,ritzetal08,skopeteasetal06,cookfildhauer11,chiarcosetal11.
Another reason is that
a large spoken corpus of standard spoken Japanese is available.

The corpus is called the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and 
is morphologically analysed and annotated with a variety of information such as accentual phrases, intonation, parts of speech, dependent structures in addition to basic transcriptions of speech maekawa03,maekawaetal04.
I will describe characteristics of the corpus in FrameworkCorpus.




Conceptual space and semantic mapsFrameworkSemanticMap

Throughout this study,
I assume a theory of conceptual space croft01,haspelmath03.
A conceptual space is a multi-dimensional model of concept sensitive to some linguistic function(s).
As [93]croft01 states,
``conceptual space is a structured representation of functional structures and their relationships to each other. [...] Conceptual space is also multidimensional, that is, there are many different semantic, pragmatic, and discourse-functional dimensions that define any region of conceptual space''.
It is claimed to be universal.
An example of conceptual space is shown in Figure FrameworkCSF.
This is a conceptual space of parts of speech.
The horizontal dimension given in capital letters indicates
``the constructions used for the propositional acts of reference, modification, and predication'' [][p. 93]croft01.
The vertical dimension indicates the semantic classes of ``the words that fill the relevant roles in the propositional act constructions''  (op.cit.: 94).

Whereas
``the conceptual space is the underlying conceptual structure,
[...] a semantic map is a map of language-specific categories on the conceptual space'' (p. 94).
While conceptual space is supposed to be universal,
semantic maps are language-specific.
Figure FrameworkSMF is an example of a semantic map of parts of speech specific to Japanese.
The dimensions are suppressed for the purpose of convenience.
The figure shows that
nouns such as hon `book' accompany no to modify another noun and da for predication. 
Adjectives such as yasu `cheap' accompany i for both modification and predication. 
Some nominal adjectives between `book' and `cheap' such as heewa `peace(ful)' and kenkoo `health(y)' accompany both no and na for modification and da for predication.
They are different from but similar to nouns such as `book'.
Some nominal adjectives such as atataka `warm' and tiisa `small' accompany both na and i for modification, and
`warm' allows both da and i to follow in predication.
This indicates that
they are similar to adjectives rather than nouns.
The nominal adjective kirei `pretty' is in between;
it only allows na for modification and da for predication.

 The semantic map for the Japanese Nominal, Nominal Adjective, and Adjective constructions [95]croft01

figure

``The hypothesis of typological theory, including Radical Construction Grammar,
is that most grammatical domains will yield universals of the form-function mapping that can be represented as a coherent conceptual space'' (p. 96), which is explicitly stated in .

. SemanticMapHypSemantic Map Connectivity Hypothesis: any relevant language-specific and construction-specific category should map onto a connected region in conceptual space. (ibid.)

Japanese parts of speech in Figure FrameworkSMF support this hypothesis.
For example,
morphemes such as no and na map onto different but connected regions on the conceptual space.
If the adjective suffix i could also attach to hon `book', but not to kirei `pretty', for example,
this would be a counter-example to the hypothesis.

There are also conceptual spaces for information structure,
and I aim here to describe semantic maps of information structure in Japanese.
In terms of the theory of conceptual space,
each feature that has been proposed to correlate with information structure (to be discussed in the next section) is considered to be a dimension of the conceptual space.
Hence, the question I am pursuing here can be restated as follows:
what dimensions Japanese is sensitive to, and
how linguistic forms (i.e., particles, word order, and intonation) in Japanese map onto the semantic map of information structure in Japanese.

In the following section,
I outline the definitions of topic and focus I adopt and
the features correlating with topic and focus
which are considered to be dimensions of conceptual space for information structure.



Topic, focus, and correlating featuresFrameworkDefinition

It has been pointed out that
there is a correlation between a topic and
a referent that is activated, definite, specific, animate, agent, and inferable,
and between a focus and
a referent that is inactivated, indefinite, non-specific, inanimate, and patient
givon76,keenan76,comrie79,comrie83.
They form a prototype category;
e.g., topics are typically (i.e., frequently) but not always definite or animate, and
foci are typically but not always indefinite or inanimate.






I propose that
the feature presupposed is a necessary feature of topic,
while the feature asserted is a necessary feature of focus.
On the other hand, other features correlate with topic and focus respectively but are not necessarily topics or foci themselves.
The features correlated with topic and focus are summarized in .
.ISFeatures

	 & topic & focus 

	a. & presupposed & asserted 

	b. & evoked & brand-new 

	c. & definite & indefinite 

	d. & specific & non-specific 

	e. & animate & inanimate 

	f. & agent & patient 

	g. & inferable & non-inferable 


tabular

As will be shown in the following chapters,
topic and focus are heterogeneous
and have complex features proposed in ISFeatures.

In this section,
I will define each term in .


TopicFrameworkTopic

A linguistic form is considered to represent a topic
if it has the characteristics as in BackDefTopic in BackSubsecDefTopic,
here repeated as .

.FrameworkTopicDefTopic is a discourse element that the speaker assumes or presupposes to be shared (known or taken for granted) and uncontroversial in a given sentence both by the speaker and the hearer.









Since the proposition that ``the speaker assumes or presupposes to be shared both by the speaker and the hearer'' is too long and complicated,
this statement is sometimes shortened to ``shared by the speaker and the hearer'' to mean the same thing.
Remember that the statement is always the speaker's assumption
and hence avoids the paradox pointed out in clarkmarshall81.
The topic is by definition presupposed to be shared both by the speaker and the hearer.
By ``topic is shared'',
I mean that topics are either evoked, inferable, declining, or unused
in terms of the given-new taxonomy Back:Top:DefTop:GNTaxonomy in BackSubsecDefTopic.
By ``topic is presupposed'',
I mean that the speaker assumes that the hearer takes it for granted that the referent or the proposition being mentioned is known or accepted both by the speaker and the hearer.
See also the discussion in BackSubsecDefTopic.

Also, the notion of uncontroversial is important;
topics cannot be questioned or argued against in a normal manner.
For instance,
English noun phrases preceded by as for or regarding cannot be questioned or argued against.
Assuming that expressions like regarding and as for introduce topic expressions kuno72,kuno76,gundel74,
this supports the idea that topics cannot be questioned or argued against.
In , for example,
John preceded by as for or regarding cannot be felicitously argued against as shown in [B2,B2],
whereas a teacher, which is considered to be focus,
can be argued against as in [B2].

. BackExJohn.[A1:] Do you remember the guys we met at the last night's party?BackExJohnA
     Their names are Karl and John, I guess.
     Karl is doing linguistics at the grad school of our university.
     I forgot what languages he speaks.
     .[] [As for/Regarding John], [he] [is a teacher].
     .[B2:] ??No, Rob is a teacher.
     .[B2:] ??No, as for/regarding Rob, he is a teacher.
     .[B2:] No, John is an engineer.


In other words, topic expressions cannot be corrected by the next speaker in a normal manner.
I call this type of test the no-test
 (see also the lie-test in [39]erteschik-shir07).

Careful readers might think that it is perfectly natural to produce an utterance like which is very similar to [B2],
speculating that the no-test is a flawed test.
The capital letters in indicates that
those words are stressed.

. .[B2:]BackExRob No, ROB is a teacher, not JOHN.

However, this does not mean that the test is flawed.
Note that the participants of this conversation would not be satisfied only with ;
John's information needs to be provided.
Therefore, a ``complete'' conversation is something like .

. .[A1:] [As for/Regarding John], [he] [is a teacher]. (=BackExJohnA)
     .[B2:] No, ROB is a teacher, not JOHN. (=BackExRob)
     .[A3:] Then what is John?
     .[B4:] I guess he is an engineer.

This suggests that
once B says no, s/he must provide an alternative to the focus (as long as s/he knows).
I am inclined to label ROB in [B2] as focus
and think that the existence of examples like [B] does not invalidate the no-test.

It is also unnatural to overtly receive topics as news
because overt acceptance indicates that they could be controversial.
For instance, as shown in [B2],
topics cannot be repeated as news by the next speaker who has heard the utterance [A1],
whereas there is no problem to repeat the focus as news as in [B2].

.aha .[A1:] [As for/Regarding John], [he] [is a teacher].
     .[B2:] ??Aha, John.
     .[B2:] Aha, a teacher.


I call this test the aha-test.
The aha-test is a natural consequence of the fact that
the truth value of a sentence is assessed with respect to topic strawson64.

Let us see specific examples of topics.
For instance,
as will be shown in Chapter Particles,
preposed zero-coded elements (elements without any overt particles) correspond to topics in Japanese
because the referent that the preposed element refers to is presupposed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer as nezumi `mouse' in ,
where O indicates ``a zero particle''.
	. FrameworkExMouseContext: Y and H are roommates,
		who are bothered by a mouse running in their room
		and eating their leftovers.
		The cat they keep finally caught the mouse while H was out.
		When H is back, Y wants to let H know this news.
		.[Y:] nezumi-O neko-ga tukamae-ta-yo 

			nezumi-O cat-ga catch-past-fp 

			`The cat caught (the) mouse.'
	
The referent `mouse' is interpreted as shared between the speaker and the hearer;
when the mouse is not shared between the speaker and the hearer as in ,
the utterance is infelicitous as shown by the contrast between [Y] and [Y].
	. TopDefContext: Y and his cat is relaxing in the living room.
		H comes into the room.
		.[H:] Anything fun today?
		.[Y:] ??nezumi-O neko-ga tukamae-ta-yo 

			mouse-O cat-ga catch-past-fp 

			Intended: `The cat caught a mouse.' (=[Y])
		.[Y:] neko-ga nezumi-O tukamae-ta-yo 

			cat-ga mouse-O catch-past-fp 

			`The cat caught a mouse.'

When the mouse is not shared between the speaker (Y) and the hearer (H),
the preposed nezumi `mouse' is infelicitous as in [Y],
while nezumi in the pre-predicate position is felicitous as in [Y].












Some readers might think that preposed zero-coded elements do not necessarily correspond to topics;
Instead, readers might suspect that they correspond to foci
because nezumi `mouse' in is somehow ``new'' to the discourse,
or, more precisely,
it is not activated before the time of utterance [Y].
However, as discussed below,
foci are not subject to a constraint such that their referent must be assumed to be shared by the speaker and the hearer.
Typically, foci are indefinite referents that are not shared as specified in ISFeatures.
Since the preposed zero-coded elements in Japanese do not refer to indefinite referents, as shown in ,
I categorize them as topics.


FocusFrameworkFocus

A linguistic form is considered to represent focus if it has the characteristics given in BackFocDef in BackSubsecDefFocus,
repeated here as for convenience.

. Focus is a discourse element that the speaker assumes to be news to the hearer and possibly controversial.
S/he wants the hearer to learn the relation of the presupposition to the focus by his/her utterance.
In other words, focus is an element that is asserted.
FocDef

A focused discourse element is news in the sense that
the hearer is assumed not to know the relationships between the element and the presupposition.
For example,
consider the following example .
. .[Q:] Who broke the window?
	.[A:] hanako-ga wat-ta-n-da-yo 

		Hanako-ga break-past-nmlz-cop-fp 

		`HANAKO broke (it).'
	.[] Presupposition: ``x broke the window.''
	.[] Assertion: ``x = Hanako''

In [A],
hanako is shared in the sense that
her existence and identity are known by the speaker and the hearer.
However,
hanako is also news in relation to the presupposition
``x broke the window'' at the time of utterance [Q].
The speaker of [A] lets the hearer learn the proposition that is assumed to be news: ``x = Hanako.''
Hanako is the focus because
this is the part where the assertion is different from the presupposition.

I also emphasize that the speaker thinks that the focus might be controversial.
This implies that another participant of the conversation can potentially argue against the focus statement.


Therefore, the focus can be felicitously negated by the next speaker,
whereas the topic cannot.
This is exemplified in BackExJohn, repeated here as .

. BackExJohn2.[A:] Do you remember the guys we met at the last night's party?
     Their names are Karl and John, I guess.
     Karl is doing linguistics at the grad school of our university.
     I forgot what languages he speaks.
     .[] [As for/Regarding John], [he] [is a teacher].
     .[B:] ??No, Rob is a teacher.
     .[B:] ??No, as for/regarding Rob, he is a teacher.
     .[B:] No, John is an engineer.


As shown in ,
(part of) the focus a teacher can be negated felicitously,
whereas the topic John cannot be negated felicitously.
The concept of controversialness is more hearer-oriented and interactional than the previous notions such as assertions, unpredictability, and unrecoverablity.
See also the discussion in BackSecFocus.






Information structure in a sentenceFrameworkIS





Here I discuss types of information structure.
Following lambrecht94,
I distinguish three types of information structures within a sentence:
predicate-focus structure (topic-comment structure),
sentence-focus structure, and
argument-focus structure.





In the predicate-focus structure or the topic-comment structure,
the predicate is the focus, as the name suggests.
The predicate may include the complement of the predicate.
This is exemplified in [A] for English,
where the capital letters represent prominence in English.
. Predicate-focus structure
	.[Q:] (What did the children do next?)
	.[A:] [The children] [went to SCHOOL].
	[][p. 121]lambrecht94

[A] is an example of predicate-focus structure in Japanese.

.
 .[Q:] What is Hanako doing?
 .[A:] [Hanako-wa] [syoosetu-o yon-deru]-yo 

		Hanako-wa novel-o read-prog-fp 

		`Hanako is reading a novel.'







































In the sentence-focus structure,
the whole sentence is focused.
This is exemplified in [A] for English,
where, again, the capital letters indicate stress.
. Sentence-focus structure
	.[Q:] What happened?
	.[A:] [The CHILDREN went to SCHOOL]!
	[][p. 121]lambrecht94

A Japanese example of sentence-focus structure is shown in [A].
. Sentence-focus structure
	.[Q:] What happened? 
	.[A:] [hanako-ga syoosetu(-o) yon-deru]-yo 

		Hanako-ga novel-o read-prog-fp 

		`Hanako is reading a novel!'

In sentence-focus structure,
there is no explicit topic and all the arguments (e.g., the children and school in [A]) are part of the focus.
However, if one assumes stage topics erteschik-shir97,erteschik-shir07,
the distinction between the predicate-focus and the sentence-focus structures may not be clear.



In [a], for example,
kyoo `today' might function as a topic in the sense that
the truth value of the sentence is evaluated with respect to the specific time `today' (although, in this study, I do not examine stage topics in detail).
. 
	. [kyoo-wa] [hanako-ga syoosetu(-o) yon-deru]-yo 

		today-wa Hanako-ga novel(-o) read-prog-fp 

		`Today Hanako is reading a novel.'
		. [Hanako-wa] [syoosetu-o yon-deru]-yo 

		Hanako-wa novel-o read-prog-fp 

		`Hanako is reading a novel.'

Note that, in terms of information structure,
[a] is similar to [b],
which has predicate-focus structure.
The predicate-focus and sentence-focus structures are similar
in that the predicate is in the domain of focus.
For this reason, I sometimes put the predicate-focus and sentence-focus structures into the same category
and refer to them as broad focus structures.

In the argument-focus structure,
elements other than predicates are focused.
This is exemplified in [A] for English
and [A] for Japanese.
This structure is sometimes referred to as the narrow focus structure
as opposed to broad focus structure
because the domain of focus is limited to arguments or other elements except for predicates.
. Argument-focus structure
	.[Q:] Who went to school?
	.[A:] [The CHILDREN] [went to school]. [][p. 121]lambrecht94

. Argument-focus structure
	.[Q:] Who is reading a book?
	.[A:] [hanako-ga] [syoosetu(-o) yon-deru]-yo 

		Hanako-ga book(-o) read-prog-fp 

		`Hanako is reading a book.'




I distinguish between two types of components constituting an information structure:
discourse element and discourse referent,
each of which is defined as in :
.
	. (Discourse) element: A unit of linguistic form (including zero pronoun) that is uttered by the participants in discourse.
	. (Discourse) referent: An entity or proposition that a discourse element refers to (if a referent is a proposition, it is also called proposition).




Other features correlating with topic/focusFrameworkOthFeatures

This section discusses the definition of features which have been
proposed to correlate with topic and focus.
Although I do not necessarily annotate all the features in my corpus,
I discuss all of them
since, in some place or other, they are relevant to my proposals.






Activation costFrameworkActivation
The activation cost of a referent is the assumed cost for the hearer to activate the referent in question.
An active referent is a referent
that the speaker assumes to be in the attention of the hearer (and hence the activation cost is low),
while an inactive referent is a referent
that the speaker does not assume to be in the attention of the hearer (and hence the activation cost is high)
[see also][inter alia]chafe94.
	 
	I am using the term attention rather than consciousness
	because I believe the speaker's ability to evaluate the hearer's state of mind is eventually related to joint attention tomasello99.
	
Typically,
referents are assumed to be brought to the hearer's attention
by mentioning them or putting them in the hearer's area of visual perception.

A topic referent is often, but not always, activated in the hearer's mind.
In FrameworkExMouse,
the referent `mouse' is not necessarily considered to be active in H's mind.
Although the mouse kept bothering Y and H sometimes when they were in their room,
it is not appropriate for the speaker to assume that the mouse is in H's attention anymore in school when the speaker happened to talk to H.

According to dryer96,
focus is an element that is not activated.
While this generalization well captures the view that the focus is the stressed linguistic element,
I will not employ this definition of focus in this study
because if nezumi `mouse' in FrameworkExMouse is focus,
one has to come up with an explanation for why it is assumed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer,
which is typically not the case with focus.
According to my account, on the other hand,
nezumi `mouse' in FrameworkExMouse is topic because the the characteristics are in accordance with topic correlation features in ISFeatures
and a special account for why nezumi `mouse' is shared is not necessary.
For detailed discussion of the relationships between focus and stress,
see [Chapter 5]lambrecht94.

A focus referent, on the other hand, is typically assumed not to be active in the hearer's mind.
As lambrecht94 has pointed out,
the most frequent focus structure is predicate-focus structure as in [A,B],
where elements included in the predicate focus are typically not active in the hearer's mind.
.tomodati .[Q:] What did you guys do today?
	.[A:] [watasi-wa] [tomodati-to resutoran-de supagetii tabe-ta]-yo 

			1.sg-wa friend-with restaurant-loc spaghetti eat-past-fp 

			`I ate spaghetti with (a) friend in (a) restaurant.'
	.[B:] [boku-wa] [uti-de hon yon-de-ta]-yo 

			1.sg-wa home-loc book read-prog-past-fp 

			`I was reading (a) book at home.'

In ,
it is reasonable to assume that
Q did not have `friend', `restaurant', `spaghetti', `home', and `book' in his/her attention at the time of utterance [Q].


There is another type of activation status: semi-active.
I use the term declining specifically for the referent that has been active but starts to decline because other referents are also activated.
Declining elements are in semi-active state.


DefinitenessFr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite

A definite referent is a referent
that is unique in the domain of discourse,
while an indefinite referent is a referent
that is not unique in the domain of discourse.

The claim that ``topic is a discourse element that the speaker assumes or presupposes to be shared (known or taken for granted) and uncontroversial in a given sentence both by the speaker and the hearer'' in FrameworkTopicDef 
might lead to the interpretation that the topic is definite.
As has been pointed out in the literature givon76,keenan76,comrie79,comrie83,
topics tend to be definite.
However, this is not a necessary nor sufficient feature of topics.
Let us discuss the following example .
	 
	I am grateful to Yoshihiko Asao
	for pointing out this type of example.
	
.Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite:Ex:Mango1Context:
	Y told H that he had never seen and eaten mangoes.
	H told Y that they are delicious.
	Several days later, Y finally ate a mango.
	.[Y:] mangoo konoaida miyako-zima-de tabe-ta-yo 

			mango the.other.day Miyako-island-loc eat-past-fp 

			`(I) ate (a) mango (we talked about) in Miyako island the other day.'

In `mango' is indefinite because the mango Y ate is not unique in the domain of discourse; H cannot uniquely identify which mango Y ate.
  
 Yuji Togo and one of the reviewers (Morimoto) cast doubt on my claim
      that mangoo in Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite:Ex:Mango1 is indefinite;
      Rather, they suggest that it could be generic.
      I am reluctant to accept this view because
      this mangoo seems to refer to a specific (non-generic) mango
      that Y ate, as indicated by the past tense of the predicate tabe-ta `eat-past'.


      
 
However, the element mangoo `mango' is preposed because it has been discussed and hence is assumed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer.
This makes it possible for mangoo to appear clause-initially as will be discussed in Chapter WordOrder.



















I include this type of example in the category of unused,
extending the term ``unused'' in prince81.

However,
some indefinite referents are more difficult to interpret as topics than others.
For example, expressions such as dareka `somebody' and oozee-no hito `many people' are poor candidates for topic than others
judging from the fact that they cannot be followed by wa, but can be followed by ga in Japanese as shown in [][p. 37 ff.]kuno73.
As will be shown in Chapter Particles,
wa codes the element whose referent is assumed to be active in the hearer's mind;
wa codes active topics.
On the other hand, as will also be shown in Chapter Particles,
ga codes focus elements.
. . dareka-??wa/ga byooki-desu 

		somebody-wa/ga sick-cop.plt 

		`Speaking of somebody, he is sick.'
	. oozee-no hito-??wa/ga paatii-ni ki-masi-ta 

		many-gen person-wa/ga party-to come-plt-past 

		`Speaking of many people, they came to the party.'



A focus referent, on the other hand,
tends to be indefinite rather than definite givon76,keenan76,comrie79,comrie83,dubois87.
As has been mentioned above,

the most frequent focus structure is predicate-focus structure exemplified in tomodati and
it is reasonable to assume that Q in tomodati cannot identify the referents included in the predicate focus such as `friend', `restaurant', `spaghetti', and `book'.










It is natural for topic referents to be frequently realized by definite noun phrases.
The participants typically talk about the person or the thing whose identity is known by them.
Or sometimes they talk about people or something in more general terms.
This is an exceptional case known as a generic referent and requires a special account.
On the other hand, it is natural for focus referents to be frequently realized by indefinite noun phrases
because, intuitively, an element that is not known by the hearer in relation to a presupposition is typically not shared between the speaker and the hearer.




Specificity

A specific referent is fixed, namely, the speaker has one particular referent in his/her mind;
while a non-specific referent is not fixed,
i.e., the speaker does not have one particular referent in mind karttunen69diss,enc91,abbott94.
Turkish unambiguously codes specific and non-specific objects:
if the NP is coded by the accusative case marker -(y)i (or -(y)u),
it is interpreted as specific as in [a],
while, if the NP is not overtly coded,
it is interpreted as non-specific as in [b].
. . Ali bir piyano-yu kiralamak istiyor 

	Ali one piano-acc to.rent wants 

	`Ali wants to rent a certain piano.'
	. Ali bir piyano kiralamak istiyor 

	Ali one piano to.rent wants 

	`Ali wants to rent a (non-specific) piano.'
	[][p. 4-5]enc91

Specific referents like `piano' in [a] are fixed
in the sense that
the speaker wants to rent a particular piano in his/her mind.
Non-specific referents like `piano' in [b] are not fixed
in the sense that
the speaker does not care which piano s/he could rent;
any piano works in [b].

Topics are frequently but not always specific.
Consider the following example ,
which is slightly modified from Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite:Ex:Mango1.

.Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Specificity:MangoContext:
	Y told H that he had never seen and eaten mangoes.
	H told Y that they are delicious.
	Several days later, Y finally got a chance to eat a mango.
	.[Y:] mangoo raisyuu miyako-zima-de taberu-yo 

			mango next.week Miyako-island-loc eat-fp 

			`(I will) eat (a) mango (we talked about) in Miyako island next week.'

In this case, mangoo is non-specific because speaker Y does not know which mango he will eat.
However, it is the topic at the same time for the same reason discussed in association with Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite:Ex:Mango1.

There is a concept that is related to but distinct from non-specificity: genericity.
Generic referents do not represent an individual entity,
but do represent a concept or a category.
On the other hand, non-specific referents still represent an individual entity.
According to kuno72,
generic referents are always available to be topic.
In ,
the element kuzira corresponds to a generic referent as the topic.

. kuzira-wa honyuudoobutu-desu 

		whale-wa mammal-cop.plt 

		`A whale is a mammal.' [][p. 270]kuno72

When participants talk about generic referents,
the referent that is presupposed to be shared is the concept itself.
Therefore, generic referents are always shared
(unless the hearer has never heard the expression in question).
As will be shown in Chapter Particles, however,
wa codes the element whose referent is assumed to be active or semi-active inferable in the hearer's mind and
not all generic elements can be coded by wa.


Foci, on the other hand, can be either specific or non-specific,
but tend to be non-specific.
In [A],
the speaker may or may not have a particular book in his/her mind.

. .[Q:] What are you going to do tomorrow?
	.[A:] [I]'m going to [read a book tomorrow].



In the example above,
the specificity of the book in question is not important.
Instead, the whole event of reading a book is more relevant to the question.







Animacy

An animate referent is a living entity such as human beings, cats, and dogs,
while an inanimate referent is a non-living entity such as computers, books, and love.
Snakes, bugs, plants, and flowers are somewhere in between.

Topic tends to be animate,
while focus tends to be inanimate givon76,keenan76,comrie79,comrie83,dubois87.
Although this study does not discuss animacy very much,
it is relevant to some aspects of the distinction between
zero vs. overt particles,
as briefly mentioned in Chapter Particles.



Agentivity

I employ the prototypes of the agent and the patient
discussed in [][inter alia]dowty91.
An agent is a referent
that typically has volition,
has sentience,
causes an event or change of state in another participant, or
moves.
On the other hand,
a patient is a referent
that typically undergoes a change of state,
corresponds to an incremental theme,
is causally affected by another participant, or
stationary relative to movement of another participant.

Agentivity or subjecthood is often discussed in association with topic [][inter alia]li76.


However, it is inaccurate to assume that a topic is limited to an agent
or that an agent is always the topic.
It is important to keep in mind that
topic correlates with agent or subject
but being an agent or subject itself is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition to be topic.
Focus, on the other hand, correlates with patients.
In the same way as topic, however,
it is inaccurate to assume that all foci are patients.
The relationships between topic/focus and agentivity are discussed in Chapter Particles,
in association with the distinction between zero vs. overt particles.



Inferability







The term inferable is borrowed from prince81
though many other scholars have discussed similar concepts [e.g.,][]havilandclark74,chafe94.
A discourse referent is inferable
``if the speaker assumes the hearer can infer it, via logical --  or, more commonly, plausible -- reasoning, from [discourse referents] already [active] or from other inferables'' [][p. 236]prince81.
	 
	The terms are replaced according to this study's terminology.
	
A referent is inferable typically through
the part-whole or metonymic relationships between the referent and another referent that has been already active.
Inferable referents can be a topic
by being assumed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer,
or can be focus.

























MethodologyFrameworkTFIdent

In this section,
I will discuss the methods in this study,
based on the definitions and assumptions of the topic and the focus specified in the last section.
This study employs acceptability judgements,
production experiments, and
corpus annotation,
to be discussed in the following sections.






Topic and focus in acceptability judgements

In acceptability judgements,
I sometimes employ the hee test,
where the element in question is focus if it can be repeated after the expression hee `really',
while it is not if it cannot.
See also the discussions in BackSubsecDefTopic, BackSubsecDefFocus, FrameworkTopic, and FrameworkFocus.
The hee-test is exemplified in .
  
  
  Read Jiro's utterance in Fr:Method:Ex:Hebi with exclamative intonation.
  Question intonation always works regardless of whether the element in question
  is topic or focus.
  
 
.Fr:Method:Ex:Hebi .[Taro:] kinoo-sa [ore] [hebi mi-ta-n-da]-yo 

		yesterday-fp 1sg snake see-past-nmlz-cop-fp 

	`Yesterday [I] [saw a snake]!'
	.[Jiro:] hee, ??kinoo / ??taroo / hebi (mi-ta-n-da)! 

			really yesterday / Taro / snake (see-past-nmlz-cop) 

			`Really, yesterday? / you? / (saw) a snake?'

Let us assume that in [-Taro] it is presupposed that something happened to Taro yesterday.
Since something must always happen to Taro all the time,
this presupposition is appropriate even in an out-of-the-blue context.
Therefore,
ore `1sg' is interpreted as topic,
while hebi mi-ta-n-da `snake see-past-nmlz-cop' is interpreted as focus in this particular context.
Given this situation,
the hearer of [-Taro] can respond to this utterance as in [-Jiro]:
while the focus part hebi mi-ta-n-da `snake see-past-nmlz-cop' can be felicitously repeated followed by hee `really',
the topic part ore `1sg',
which corresponds to taroo in [-Jiro], cannot be repeated felicitously.
Topics are identified negatively in this test.
The assumption of this hee test is that
topics can never be taken as ``news'' or ``a surprise'' since they are assumed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer,
while foci are expected to be ``news'' or ``a surprise'' to the hearer.

The expression kinoo `yesterday' cannot be repeated either.
I assume that this is because kinoo `yesterday' is also a part of presupposition.
However, I am neutral as to whether or not kinoo `yesterday' is a topic
in the same sense that ore `1sg' is a topic.
It is a kind of stage topic discussed in FrameworkIS.
In this study I restrict myself to investigating elements which constitute arguments of sentences
and do not discuss much about the stage topics in detail.

In grammaticality judgements,

contexts will be provided
in order for topics to be typical topics (presupposed, definite, etc.)
and for foci to be typical foci (asserted, indefinite, etc.).
Examples of contexts which prompt different focus structures are provided in FrameworkExPredFocus to FrameworkExArgFocus,
where the target expression is koinu(-o) yuzut-ta `gave a/the puppy'.

	. FrameworkExPredFocus
	.[] Predicate-focus context: Yesterday the speaker and his/her friend found an abandoned puppy on the street. The speaker brought it to his/her home. Today, the speaker tells the friend what happened to the puppy.
	.[A:] sooieba [koinu] [yuzut-ta]-yo 

		by.the.way puppy give-past-fp 

		`By the way, (I) gave the puppy (to somebody).'


		. FrameworkExSentFocus
		.[] Sentence-focus context: the speaker and his/her friend are working in an animal shelter. The friend was absent yesterday and wants to know what happened yesterday.
		.[A:] kinoo-wa [koinu yuzut-ta]-yo 

		yesterday-wa puppy give-past-fp 

		`Yesterday (we) gave a puppy.'


. FrameworkExArgFocus.[] Argument-focus context
	.[Q:] What did you give to him?
	.[A:] [koinu-o] [yuzut-ta]-yo 

			 puppy-o give-past-fp 

			`(I) gave the/a puppy.'

In predicate-focus contexts like FrameworkExPredFocus,
typically the referent of the discourse element in question has already appeared in the context preceding the target expression;
in this example,
koinu `puppy' has appeared in the context and the speaker and the hearer share the identity of the puppy.
Therefore,
koinu `puppy' is easily presupposed and is interpreted as topic.
The speaker intends to tell the hearer what happened to the puppy
because this news is not shared with the hearer.
The readers may wonder
why I do not simply use a question like `what happened to the puppy?',
which typically prompts predicate-focus structure.
This question, however,
strongly favours omitting the element koinu `puppy'
because it appears in the immediate context.
This is the reason why
the context which prompts predicate-focus structure like FrameworkExPredFocus appears to be complicated.

In sentence-focus contexts like (FrameworkExSentFocus),
on the other hand,
typically the referent is not shared;
in A of FrameworkExSentFocus,
koinu `puppy' appears out-of-the-blue.
The whole utterance is interpreted as news or focus.
In this case, A of FrameworkExSentFocus can be easily preceded by
questions like `what happened yesterday?'.

Argument-focus contexts like FrameworkExArgFocus
are typically what- or who-questions
that prompt a single argument as answer.
In FrameworkExArgFocus,
the question prompts koinu `puppy' as answer.
`A gave (something)' is presupposed.



Assumptions in experiments

In production experiments,
I asked Japanese native speakers to read aloud sentences preceded by different contexts:
the context where the sentence is interpreted as different types of focus structures.

The contexts that prompt different types of focus structures
are designed in the same way as discussed in the last section.


Corpus annotation and analysisFrameworkCorpus

In analyzing spontaneous speech,
it is relatively difficult to apply the definition of the topic and the focus discussed above
because clean contexts are not available in contrast to the case with constructed examples.
For this reason,
I will provide the definitions of topic and focus for the corpus investigation
based on the assumptions concerning topic and focus discussed in FrameworkDefinition.

The basic idea is that, since it is difficult to determine
whether some discourse referent is presupposed or not,
I will use information status to approximate the given-new taxonomy (FW:Cor:TopFoc)

of the referent

instead of the presupposed vs. asserted distinction.
The activation status of the referent in question is approximated
by whether the referent has an antecedent or not.



Firstly, I will discuss the characteristics of the corpus (FW:Cor:Cor)
and the procedure of annotating anaphoric relations (FW:Cor:AnaRel).
Then the annotations of relevant features will be discussed (FW:Cor:TopFoc).





CorpusFW:Cor:Cor

This study investigates 12 core data of simulated public speaking 
from the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese [CSJ:][]maekawa03,maekawaetal04.
The data list and basic information are summarized in Table CorpusInfoT.
The data to be investigated are randomly chosen out of 107 core data of simulated public speaking.
Simulated public speaking is a type of speech
where the speakers talk about everyday topics
such as `my most delightful memory' or `if I live in a deserted island'.
I use the RDB version of CSJ koisoetal12 to search the corpus.

Annotation of anaphoric relationsFW:Cor:AnaRel

The information of anaphoric relations is used
to identify topic and focus.
Anaphoric relations are identified in the following way.
The basic procedures have been proposed in iidaetal07 and nakagawaden12.
.AnnotationProcedure 
	. Identification of grammatical function, discourse elements, and zero pronoun
	. Classification of discourse elements: Discourse elements are classified into categories based on what they refer to.
	. Identification of anaphoric relations:
		The link between the anaphor and the antecedent is annotated.





First,
I identified the grammatical function of clauses (a in AnnotationProcedure),
namely A, S, vs. P.
This is necessary in order to determine discourse elements and zero pronouns to be investigated.
In Japanese,
pronouns such as watasi `1sg', anata `2sg', and kare `3sg' are rare;
the most frequent pronoun is the zero pronoun.
In ,
for example, the speaker indicated by  and `the dog' indicated by  are zero pronouns,
assuming that they appear immediately before the predicates.
	
As shown in [d],
two zero pronouns  and  can appear in the same clause;
still, native speakers have no trouble in understanding the utterance.
. . yo-nen-kan amerika-de sigoto-o  si-teru aida 

			four-year-for America-loc work-o  do-prog during 

			`While (I) was working for four years,'
	. aa zutto kono inu-to issyoni eii  sun-de 

		fl all.the.time this dog-with together fl  live-and 

		`(I) lived with this dog all the time.'
	. sikamo oo tabi-o  suru toki-mo 

		moreover fl travel-o  do time-also 

		`Moreover, also when (I) travel,'
	. kuruma-ni   nose-te 

		car-loc   put-and 

		`(I) put (the dog) in my car.'
	. ee amerika-o tabi  si-ta-to 

		fl America-acc travel  do-past-q 

		`(I) traveled America.'
		(S02M1698: 182.88-195.87)







I identified 7697 discourse elements (5234 NPs, 655 overt pronouns, and 1808 zero pronouns) from the corpus.

Second, I classified discourse elements into 13 categories depending on what they refer to b in AnnotationProcedure:
common referent, connective, speaker, hearer, time, filler, exophora, question, quantifier, degree words, proposition, and other.
Although there are many categories,
only common referents are relevant for the purpose of this study.
Other categories were annotated for future studies.
Also, I limit my analyses to A, S, P, and Ex (to be discussed below).
Datives are also added for comparison.
This process leaves us
2301 elements (1662 NPs, 80 overt pronouns, and 559 zero pronouns).
However, I occasionally use data which include other kinds of elements
for detailed analysis.

Third,
I identified the anaphoric relation for each discourse element (c in AnnotationProcedure).
A unique ID number is given for the set of discourse elements which refer to the same entity.
In , for example,
syoo-doobutu `a small animal' in line a,
O in line c, e, and f refers to the small animal introduced in line a.
All of them are given the ID number 1 because they refer to the same entity.
The element syoo-doobutu `a small animal' is called the antecedent of the anaphor O in line c.
In the same way, the element O in line c is the antecedent of the anaphor O in line e.
The element watasi refers to another entity, the speaker,
and is given another ID number 2.

Using the anaphoric relations and various information in the corpus,
I generated other relevant features to be discussed in the next section.


Annotation of topichood and focushoodFW:Cor:TopFoc


Approximation to the given-new taxonomy

The status of a referent in the given-new taxonomy is approximated by
whether the expression referring to the referent has an antecedent or not.
An expression that has an antecedent is called an anaphoric element,
while an expression that does not have an antecedent is called a non-anaphoric element.
I use the term information status to refer to the status of a referent being anaphoric or non-anaphoric.
Note that the terms anaphoric vs. non-anaphoric are used in Chapter Particles, WordOrder, and Intonation only to refer to corpus counts.
The referent of an anaphoric elements is assumed to be either evoked or declining in terms of the given-new taxonomy and active or semi-active in terms of activation status.
On the other hand, the referent of a non-anaphoric elements is inferable, unused, or new in terms of the given-new taxonomy and
semi-active or inactive in terms of activation status.
I prefer to use the terms of the given-new taxonomy over activation status because
they are more fine-grained.
The correspondence among activation statuses, the given-new taxonomy, and corpus annotations are shown in Table ActStatusCorpus.
The distinction between inferable, declining, unused, and brand-new is judged manually when necessary.
By ``shared'', I mean the referent is evoked, declining, inferable, or unused in terms of the given-new taxonomy.

Grammatical function

Following comrie78 and dixon79,
I distinguish S, A, and P in grammatical function.
S is the only argument of intransitive clause,
A is the agent-like argument of transitive clause,
and P is the patient-like argument of transitive clause.
For now, I simply distinguish A and P based on whether the argument in question is or can be coded by ga or o.
When it can be coded by ga, it is A;
when it can be coded by o, it is P.
Furthermore, I sometimes distinguish agent S and patient S if needed.





In addition to S, A, and P,
I identify non-argument elements (Ex).FW:Cor:TopFoc:ExDef
Non-argument elements are those which appear to be part of the clause but do not have direct relationships with the predicate.
A typical example is shown in .

. zoo-wa hana-ga nagai 

		elephant-wa nose-ga long 

		`The elephant, the nose is long (The elephant has a long nose).' mikami60

As exemplified in ,
the element zoo `elephant' is considered to be Ex.
Hana `nose' is the only argument of the predicate (S),
and zoo `elephant' does not have direct relationships with the predicate nagai `long';
still, zoo `elephant' looks like part of the clause and needs a label,
which happens to be ``Ex''.

Although Ex is frequently coded by so-called topic markers
such as wa and toiuno-wa,
wa- and toiuno-wa-coded elements are not always labelled as Ex.
If they are considered to be S, A, or P,
they are labelled as such.
For example, in the case where hana `nose' is coded by wa like ,
nose is labelled as S, instead of Ex.

. zoo-no hana-wa nagai 

      elephant-gen nose-wa long 

      `The elephant's nose is long.'













Other features

Ideally, it is necessary to annotate all the variables proposed in ISFeatures,
but it is impossible to annotate all of them,
partially because of the limitation of time and labor and 
partially because of the lack of clear criteria to annotate them consistently.
For example, definiteness and specificity are difficult to annotate consistently.
Multiple annotators are needed for reliable and objective analyses.
Animacy could be simpler, but I have not annotated this feature throughout the corpus due to the limitation of time and labor.
The previous literature indicates that
these features play little role in Japanese grammar.
These features will be discussed when necessary.































































































































































































Summary

In this chapter,
I discussed
the framework employed in this study and
the method of corpus annotation and analysis.
In the next three chapters,
different aspects of spoken Japanese grammar (i.e., particles, word order, and intonation) will be analyzed based on the framework and methodology discussed in this chapter.









ParticlesParticles























IntroductionParIntro

In this chapter, I will describe
so-called topic particles coding different kinds of topics (TopPar)
and
so-called case particles coding different kinds of foci and grammatical functions (CasePar).
Table ParInfoStatusT summarizes kinds of so-called topic particles and case particles
coding topics and focus in different statuses of the given-new taxonomy.
The activation status is also specified in the table to show the correspondence,
although I mainly use the terms of the given-new taxonomy.
The shaded cells indicate that they are indistinguishable with each other in the annotation proposed in FrameworkTFIdent
Different topic particles attach to elements in different statuses of the given-new taxonomy,
while case particles are not sensitive to the given-new taxonomy.
Instead, case particles are sensitive to the grammatical functions and the broad vs. narrow focus distinction,
which is summarized in Table OvertZeroCaseParT1.
The morpheme cop indicates copula.

table

I argue that these tables are a kind of semantic map croft01,haspelmath03.
By arguing that Tables ParInfoStatusT and OvertZeroCaseParT1 are examples of semantic maps,
I postulate that
the scales of the given-new taxonomy (the column) and the topic vs. focus distinction (the row) in Table ParInfoStatusT and
the contrast vs. non-contrast distinction (the column) and the grammatical function (the row) in OvertZeroCaseParT1 are cognitively real and continuous in the way they are ordered in the tables.
This argument and the Semantic Map Connectivity Hypothesis SemanticMapHyp in FrameworkSemanticMap lead us to our hypotheses .

. SemanticMapHypIS
 Semantic Map Connectivity Hypothesis of Information Structure:
 Since the scales of given-new taxonomy and the topic vs. focus distinction in Table ParInfoStatusT and
the contrast vs. non-contrast distinction and the grammatical function in OvertZeroCaseParT1 are cognitively continuous,
	the particles
	
	map onto a connected region in the conceptual space.

The semantic maps in Table ParInfoStatusT and OvertZeroCaseParT1
support hypothesis , because
all of the particles are in connected regions.
In the following sections,
I will show the details of the distributions of these particles
with specific examples.




So-called topic particlesTopPar

As shown in Table ParInfoStatusT,
evoked elements are coded by toiuno-wa or wa,
while inferable elements are coded by wa.
Declining and unused elements are coded by a copula followed by kedo `though' or ga `though'.
The zero particle (indicated by O) can code elements in the given-new taxonomy.


The statuses in the given-new taxonomy have corresponding activation statuses in the hearer's mind assumed by the speaker.
I propose that inferable and declining elements and unused and brand-new elements are in different activation statuses in the assumed hearer's mind.

Table ParInfoStatusCTT and Figure ParInfoStatusCTF show the distributions of elements in different information status coded by different particles in our corpus.


Overall, the topic particles toiuno-wa and wa code a higher ratio of anaphoric elements than the case particles ga and o.
The particles mo and ni are included here for comparison.
In the corpus, the markers wa, toiuno-wa, and mo are the most frequent topic markers and 
ga, o, and ni are the most frequent case markers (except for no `gen').



Note that ``anaphoric'' in the present work just means ``the element in question has the co-referential antecedent'' and ``non-anaphoric'' means ``it does not.''
Elements with bridging antecedents are included in ``non-anaphoric.''
See FW:Cor:AnaRel for the details of the procedure of annotation.
A linear mixed effects model was employed to predict information status.
  
 I used R for the statistical analysis of the study.
 https://www.r-project.org
 The packages lme4 and lsmeans were employed.
 
I included particles (toiuno-wa, wa, mo, ga, o, ni), word order (nth in CSJ, see WO:Intro for the definition of this annotation), and intonation (phrasal vs. clausal IU, see Int:PIUCIU for the definitions)
as fixed effects, and speakers (TalkID) as a random effect.
The model with the effects of particles, word order, and intonation is significantly different from the model without each of those effects (likelihood ratio test,  a model without particles,  one without word order, and  without intonation).
  The effects of word order and intonation will be discussed
           in Chapters WordOrder and Intonation, respectively.
The least-squares mean for each level of the particles was calculated, and the pairwise comparisons among particles were conducted.
The results of this pairwise comparison is shown in Table Par:InfoStatusPar:LSMEANST,
which only includes the pairs of interest and those whose p-values are less than .
 
The p-values are adjusted using the Tukey method for comparing a family of multiple estimates.

The contrast of ga  o, whose estimate is , indicates that
the least-squares mean of the odds ratio of anaphoric elements coded by ga is significantly less than the least-squares mean of the odds ratio of those coded by o;
in other words, anaphoric elements are more likely to be coded by o than by ga.
Similarly, anaphoric elements are more likely to be coded by wa than by ga, by ni, and by mo.
The difference between the particles o and wa/toiuno-wa is not statistically significant.
As will be discussed in Par:ArgStr:TopHierarchy,
this is because wa (and presumably toiuno-wa) prefers to code anaphoric As over anaphoric Ps.
Also, the difference between toiuno-wa and ga is not statistically significant
because of the effect of intonation;
most of the toiuno-wa coded elements are in phrasal IUs (see Chapter Intonation).


The statistical analysis shows that
toiuno-wa codes as high a ratio of anaphoric elements as wa does.
However, detailed qualitative analysis in Toiunowa reveals that
in fact the referents of toiuno-wa-coded elements are evoked;
the referent of non-anaphoric elements coded by toiuno-wa has been introduced implicitly in the previous contexts.




On the other hand,
the referent of wa-coded elements have not necessarily been introduced in the previous contexts;
they can be inferable elements.
The zero marker O does not appear frequently enough in the corpus because CSJ consists of formal speech.
As has already been pointed out in tsutsui84 and discussed in BackSubSubZero,
zero markers tend not to appear in formal speech.



There are not enough examples for the copula followed by ga or kedo (7 examples)
and I refrain from generalizing by this small amount of data.
Instead,
I will employ grammatical judgements and analyze these examples qualitatively,
which is also supported by the observations in the previous literature.

I also calculated the persistence of each element.
Persistence,
which is proposed in givon83 to measure topichood,
is the number of times the referent is mentioned
after it is mentioned by the expression in question.
The persistence of elements is shown in Table ParPerNumT.
The table shows the count of persistent and non-persistent elements;
the persistent elements are mentioned at least once in the following discourse after it is mentioned,
while non-persistent elements are not mentioned in the following discourse.
See FW:Cor:AnaRel for the procedure of annotation.
A linear mixed effects model was applied to predict persistence (persistent vs. non-persistent).
I used particles (toiuno-wa, wa, mo, ga, o, ni), word order (nth in CSJ), and intonation (phrasal vs. clausal IU) as fixed effects and speakers (TalkID) as a random effect.
The model with the effects of particles, word order, and intonation is significantly different from the model without either of the effects of particles and word order (likelihood ratio test,  a model without particles,  the model without word order).
However, the model with the effects of particles, word order, and intonation is not significantly different from the model without the effect of intonation ().
The least-squares means were calculated, and the pairwise comparisons among particles were conducted.
The results of this pairwise comparison are shown in Table Par:PersistencePar:LSMEANST,
which only includes the pairs of interest and those whose p-values are less than .

Although the effect of particles is significant,
this effect mainly appears to come from the contribution of ni in contrast with toiuno-wa, wa, and o, which is not of interest in the present work.

One notable contrast is the effect of toiuno-wa in contrast to ga.
The result suggests that toiuno-wa is more likely to code persistent elements than ga.

Figure ParPerNumF shows how many times the referent in question is mentioned after the NPs or pronouns coded by each particle were mentioned.
Numbers more than or equal to 5 are compressed as ``5+''.

Elements coded by so-called topic markers cannot be repeated as news, as shown in the hypothetical conversation between A and B in the following examples.


















As in and ,
the toiuno-wa-coded elements
mooningu thii `morning tea'
	 
	As discussed in Toiunowa,
	there are some formal variations of toiuno-wa;
	tteno-wa is one of these variations.
	
and eberesuto-kaidoo `the Everest Trail'
cannot be repeated as news,
while the case-marker-coded elements kootya-ka koohii-ka `tea or coffee', tibetto `Tibet', nepparu `Nepal', and kooeki-ro `trading road'
can be repeated as news.

	.

	Oh, tea time/on places of high elevation/the possibility of danger/water








































As indicated in Table ParInfoStatusT and will be discussed below,
brand-new elements can never be coded by topic markers;
they can never be assumed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer.
Non-anaphoric elements coded by topic markers are
inferable, declining, or unused,
as will be discussed in the following sections.

For example,
as in ,
it is unacceptable for topic markers to code brand new elements oozei-no hito `many people' out of the blue.








.
 *oozei-no hito-wa paathii-ni ki-masi-ta 

  many-gen person-wa party-dat come-plt-past 

  `Speaking many people, they came to the party.'
    [ 45]kuno73





Similarly, it is unacceptable for other topic markers to code these elements, whereas ga can code them.

.
 oozei-no hito-??toiuno-wa/??da-kedo/??O/ga paathii-ni ki-masi-ta 

 many-gen person-toiuno-wa/cop-though/O/ga party-dat come-plt-past 

 `Many people came to the party.'











While oozei-no hito `many people' in was unanchored in terms of prince81,
taroo-no otoosan `Taro's father' in is anchored.
The element coded by a topic marker is still not acceptable in an out-of-the-blue context.

. a! taroo-no otoosan-??toiuno-wa/??wa/??da-kedo/O asoko-de tabako sut-teru-yo 

 oh! Taro-gen father-toiuno-wa/wa/cop-though/O there-loc cigarette smoke-prog.plt-fp 

 `Taro's father is smoking over there.'

Therefore, topic markers in Japanese are sensitive to the given-new taxonomy rather than definiteness and identifiability.
  
 I suppose that the zero particle is acceptable
 because the zero particle in this case is ambiguous between topic and focus coding.
 

Finally, as will be discussed in detail in TopZero,
an element coded by a zero particle (O) that precedes other arguments and is uttered in a coherent intonation contour
cannot be repeated as news and hence considered to be presupposed to be shared.
. mouseContext: Y and H are roommates,
	who are bothered by a mouse running around their room
	and eating their leftovers.
	The cat they keep finally caught the mouse while H was out.
	When H is back, Y wants to let H know this news.
	.[Y:] nezumi-O neko-ga tukamae-ta-yo 

		nezumi-O cat-ga catch-past-fp 

		`The cat caught (the) mouse.'
	.[H:] hee, ??nezumi, neko(-ga) 

	  Oh, mouse, cat(-ga)
	  (=FrameworkExMouse in FrameworkTopic)


In the following sections,
I analyze each topic marker in detail.


Toiuno-waToiunowa

In this section
I will show that toiuno-wa codes elements of referents
which are evoked
through explicit or implicit introduction of the elements or
availability in the universe of discourse.

There are phonetic variations of toiuno-wa:
(t)teno-wa, t(y)uuno-wa, teiuno-wa, etc.
I put them into the same category as toiuno-wa and assume that they are the same
except for stylistic difference.



Evoked elements tend to be coded by toiuno-wa

Toiuno-wa typically codes evoked elements.
As exemplified in and ,
the antecedents of the toiuno-wa-coded elements,
un `luck' in and tiryoo-hoo `treatment methods' in ,
are mentioned in the immediately preceding contexts.

.
 . syokugyoo-ni taisite-no un-toiu koto-o tyotto o-hanasi si-tai-to omoi-masu 

		job-to towards-gen luck-quot thing-o a.bit plt-talk do-want-quot think-plt 

		`I'd like to speak a bit about the role of luck in one's career.'
 . de un-toiuno-wa maa iroirona un-ga aru-to omou-n-desu-keredomo 

 	then luck-toiuno-wa fl various luck-ga exist-quot think-nmlz-plt-though 

	`I guess there are various kinds of lucks...'
	(S01F0038: 0.53-8.70)




. . de sono byooki-wa gen'in-ga humee-de 

	and that disease-wa source-ga unknown-cop 

	`And the source of that disease was unknown, and'
	. tiryoo-hoo-mo kakuritu-si-tei-mas-en-desi-ta 

		treatment-method-also establish-do-pfv-plt-neg-plt-past 

		`The treatment methods had not been established.'
	. sono tiryoo-hoo-toiuno-wa yuiitu ... suteroidozai-de sinkoo okur-aseru koto-dake-desi-ta 

		that treatment-method-toiuno-wa only ... steroid-by progress delay-caus thing-only-plt-past 

		`The only way to treat is just to delay the progress of the disease using steroid, which I cannot use.' (S02F0100: 294.39-308.12)




Non-anaphoric elements coded by toiuno-wa are considered to be evoked
through implicit introduction of an element or by the physical context.
In ,
supootu-kansen `sport watching' is non-anaphoric
but the speaker mentioned that he watched a world title match.
Thus `sport watching' is considered to be evoked
when the speaker mentioned `sports watching' with toiuno-wa coding in line c.

. . ee sekai-taitoru-sen-o-desu-ne ee terebi-de mi-masi-ta 

		fl world-title-fight-o-plt-fp fl TV-by watch-plt-past 

		`(My friend and I) watched a world title match on TV.'
	. ...
	. watasi-zisin gu -wa ee amari koo supootu-kansen-teiunowa tyotto si-nakat-ta-n-desu-ne 

		1sg-self frg -wa fl not.really fl sport-watching-toiuno-wa fl do-neg-past-nmlz-plt-fp 

		`I myself hadn't watched any kinds of sports.' (S01M0182: 52.77-79.62)





Similarly, in ,
taitoru `title (in piano competitions)' is a non-anaphoric element
but the speaker was talking about `awards' in the preceding context
and `title' can be considered to have been evoked at the time of utterance [e].

. . I have been participating in various piano competitions
	. So far the best award I received was the fourth best place in the China-Japan International Competition.
	. Beyond that, I would like to receive higher awards.
	. ano doositemo kore-wa yappari piano-o kokorozasu mono-ni totte-wa 

		fl anyhow this-wa anyway piano-o orient people-for in.terms.of-wa 

		`This, for those who want to make name as a pianist,'
	. kono taitoru-tteiuno-wa sugoku ookii-node 

		this title-toiuno-wa very big-because 

		`titles matter a lot, so...'
(S00F0209: 507.13-529.76)








In another example like ,
toiuno-wa-coded elements are considered to be evoked through ``common sense''.
is the beginning of the talk
but the speaker mentions ningen `human being' with toiuno-wa coding.
This is because
people can always talk about human beings even in out-of-the-blue contexts.
Therefore, ``human beings'' are always available as topic.
Tuuno-wa is a variation of toiuno-wa.


.ExNingenToiunowaningen-tuuno-wa hizyooni ano umaku deki-teru doobutu-da-to omoi-masu-ne 

	human-toiuno-wa very fl well created-pfv animal-cop-quot think-plt-fp 

	`I think that human beings are well-created.' 

 (S02M1698: 6.99-11.00)



Readers might think that is acceptable because `human being' is generic rather than evoked in the physical context.
However, I do not employ this account for the following two reasons:
(i) being generic is a characteristic across all toiuno-wa-coded elements (see Par:Topic:Toiunowa:Other), and
(ii) even though the elements are generic, some elements are still difficult to be coded by toiuno-wa in the beginning of speeches.

Let us discuss example ,
which is at the very beginning of a speech about travel to Hawaii.

.Par:Toiunowa:Ex:Hawaiiteema-wa hawai-too-no sizen-no subarasisa-to tabi-no tanosisa-nituite-desu 

   theme-wa Hawaii-island-gen nature-gen splendor-and travel-gen fun-about-cop 

   `The topic (of this talk) is about the splendor of Hawaii nature and fun of traveling.'
 (S00F0014: 0.30-6.08)














In this example,
the speaker did not choose to code `the splendor of Hawaii nature and fun of traveling' with toiuno-wa.
It is harder to code this with toiuno-wa than `human being' because
it is not always available as topic
even though `the splendor of Hawaii nature and fun of traveling'
is generic.




Therefore,
I argue that the acceptability of toiuno-wa coded `human being' without introduction of human beings in is possible
because it is always available as topic,
not because it is generic.



Declining or inferable elements tend not to be coded by toiuno-waToiuno-waInfSemiActUnuse

There are a few examples
where toiuno-wa codes inferable elements.
In ,
the speaker explains why she came to Iran and describes the middle school there.
The climate in Iran has not been mentioned before [c],
but is still coded by toiuno-wa.
The climate in Iran is neither implicitly introduced nor available as universal topic.
. IranClimate
 . (The speaker moved to Iran when she was a middle school student.)
 . (The school for Japanese students in Iran was small but she had a lot of fun there.)
 . eeto iran-no kikoo-tteiuno-wa tomokaku kansoo si-tei-masi-te 

 	fl Iran-gen climate-toiuno-wa at.any.rate dry do-prog-plt-and 

	`Uh, the climate in Iran was very dry...'
	(S03F0072: 178.31-181.65)




Similarly, in [c],
the speaker is going to talk about a dog his family kept.
The speaker begins with the explanation why the dog came to his house.
The element keei `background (of why the dog came)' is coded by toiuno-wa,
although keei has not been explicitly mentioned in the preceding context.

.
 . (The speaker talks about a dog his family kept.)
 . (After the death of the previous dog they kept, the dog he is going to talk about joined his family.)
 . e uti-ni ki-ta keei-toiuno-wa 

 	fl home-to come-past background-toiuno-wa 

	`The background of how the dog came to our house is'
 . ma sono zyuui-san-no syookai-nan-desu-keredomo 

 	fl that vet-hon-gen introduction-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

	`(through) the introduction of that vet...'
	(S02M0198: 141.97-146.92)





On the other hand,
there are some cases where it is unnatural for toiuno-wa to code inferable elements.
For example, in [c],
the element hikoozyoo `airport' cannot naturally be coded by toiuno-wa,
which is originally coded by wa.
The airport is inferable because the speaker has already mentioned flying to Lukla.
.



	. To start Himalaya trekking, you first fly to a village called Lukla whose elevation is 2600 meters.


	. From that village, we started trekking.
	. sono rukura-no mura-nan-desu-ga 

		that Lukla-gen village-nmlz-plt-though 

		`Regarding that Lukla village,'
	. hikoozyoo-wa(/??-toiuno-wa) hontooni yama-no naka-ni ari-masi-te 

		airport-wa(/-toiuno-wa) really mountain-gen inside-in exist-plt-and 

		`the airport is really in a mountainous area.'
	(S01F0151: 179.50-191.39)





I speculate that the different acceptabilities of toiuno-wa among IranClimate, , and are due to different statuses in the given-new taxonomy or the accessibility of the elements;
`the climate' in IranClimate and `the background' in are more general terms and are more easily accessible
than `the airport' in .
Note that this does not contradict, but rather is consistent with, the Semantic Map Connectivity Hypothesis SemanticMapHypIS.
Since the given-new taxonomy scale is continuous,
the boundary between evoked and inferable is blurred, and
among the inferable elements in these examples,
`the climate' of Iran in IranClimate and `the background' in are easier to access than `the airport' in .
This is consistent with the nature of the conceptual space,
although the boundary is drawn clearly in the semantic map in Table ParInfoStatusT
for the purpose of presentation.

It is unnatural when toiuno-wa codes declining elements.
The degree of how a referent is declining is difficult to calculate from the corpus.
Apparently, it does not simply correspond to the distance between an element and its antecedent,
but the intervention of (an)other topic(s) seems to be more relevant.
For example,
a copula followed by kedo codes declining or unused elements, as will be shown in kedo.
In [g],
it codes a declining element rather than unused element
because the element has already been introduced in line a.
In line a, two potential topics `fame' and `job' are introduced.
The speaker talks about `fame' first and moves on to `job' in line g.
It is fair to assume that the topic `job' is intervened by another topic `fame'.
When the element `job' is retrieved as a current topic in line g,
it is coded by a copula followed by keredomo `though',
a variation of kedo.
However,
this marker cannot be replaced with toiuno-wa.

.sigoto
 . I have two goals: one is for fame and the other is for job.
 . Concerning fame,

	`Concerning the other one, job,'
 . to receive higher wages...
(S00F0209: 495.77-539.19)




































Toiuno-wa cannot code elements that have not been established as topic.
In ,
although `tea time' is introduced in line b,
it does not appear to be established enough as topic,
which makes toiuno-wa unnatural in line d;
the original marker is a copula followed by keredomo.

.thii-taimu
 . While we trek on the Everest Trail, the cook made us lunch on the way,
 . in addition, there is tea time and we can take a break while we climb the mountain,
 . so, we walked without feeling that we were in a big group.
 . de kono thii-taimu-nan-desu-keredomo/(??toiuno-wa) 

		and this tea-time-nmlz-cop.plt-though/toiuno-wa 

		`And at this tea time,'

		`this place of high elevation, there is a possibility of altitude sickness, so...'
 . ee mizu-ga hizyooni zyuuyooni nari-masu 

		fl water-ga very important become-plt 

		`water is very important.'
		 (S01F0151: 323.00-349.56)









These subtle differences of acceptability of toiuno-wa cannot be captured simply by counting numbers.
However, they are clear from the acceptability judgements.

Unused elements also cannot be coded by toiuno-wa.
It is very difficult to find unused elements
because of the nature of our corpus;
each speaker gave a speech in front of people s/he does not know
and there are few things the speaker can assume to be shared with the hearer(s).
However, constructed examples like clearly show that toiuno-wa cannot code unused elements.

. FacebookPartyContext: According to Facebook, both A and B are going to a party tomorrow. But they have not seen each other for a week. A sees B in a classroom and talks to B:
	.[A:] asita-no paathii-da-kedo/??toiuno-wa nan-zi-kara-na-no 

		tomorrow-gen party-cop-though/toiuno-wa what-o'clock-from-cop-q 

		`What time does tomorrow's party start?' 

Note that if the element `party' has already been introduced into the discourse, toiuno-wa can code it.
This is shown in [A].
	 
	In this example, I am using tteiuno-wa instead of toiuno-wa
	simply because this hypothetical utterance is casual;
	tteiuno-wa is more casual than toiuno-wa.
	Toiuno-wa sounds too formal in this utterance.
	
. PartyContext: A and B are having a conversation. B mentioned tomorrow's party, which A knows that both A and B are going to.
	.[A:] sono paathii-??da-kedo/tteiuno-wa nan-zi-kara-na-no 

		that party-cop-though/toiuno-wa what-o'clock-from-cop-q 

		`What time does tomorrow's party start?' 



Further characteristics of toiuno-wa-coded elementsPar:Topic:Toiunowa:Other

Statements about toiuno-wa-coded elements tend to represent the general characteristics of the referents,
as has been pointed out in masuoka87,masuoka08.
Masuoka argues that toiuno-wa-coded elements only accompany individual-level predicates (in his term, property predicates).
This is clearly shown in the contrast between [a] and [b] (repeated from ExSatiko) in Back:GeneralChar:Toiunowa.
Whereas the stage-level predication [a] does not allow toiuno-wa,
the individual-level predication [b] does allow toiuno-wa.

     Sachiko-toiuno-wa lie-commiter-cop 

     `Sachiko is a liar.'
     (Constructed)

In our corpus,
most examples of toiuno-wa also accompany individual-level predication
rather than stage-level predication.
In ,
the speaker is talking about the general characteristics of puppies.

. koinu-toiuno-wa dono syurui-demo hizyooni ano neru-no-ga tokui-desu-ne 

 puppy-toiuno-wa which kind-also very fl sleep-nmlz-ga good.at-cop.plt-fp 

 `Puppies are, no matter what kind, good at sleeping.'
 (S02M1698: 166.62-170.59)



The explanation for this requires further investigation.













 























WaWa

Wa codes inferable elements in addition to evoked elements.
Overall, the referents of wa-coded elements are assumed to be
borne in the hearer's mind at the time of utterance,
or can be easily accommodated to the assumption.


Evoked and inferable elements tend to be coded by wa

As exemplified in the following examples,
wa can code evoked elements.
In ,
`chelow kebab' is mentioned in line a,
and it is mentioned again in lines b and g.
The second and the third mentioned elements are coded by wa.

.kebab
 . There is a dish called chelow kebab.
 . de sore-wa eeto gohan-ni eeto bataa-o maze-te 

 	and that-wa fl rice-to fl butter-o mix-and 

	`That, you mix rice with butter...'
 . on top of that you put spice,
 . on top of that you put mutton,
 . you mix it and eat it.
 . There were many dishes of this kind.
 . sore-wa kekkoo sonnani hituzi-no oniku-no kusasa-mo naku-te 

 	that-wa to.some.extent not.really sheep-gen meat-gen smell-also not.exist-and 

	`It did not have smell of mutton...'
 . I thought it was delicious.
 (S03F0072: 446.03-471.72)











Also in ,
`the result of the medical exam' is mentioned in line b,
and it is mentioned again in line c, which is coded by wa.

.kensakekka
 . de sosite is-syuu anoo zibun-de-mo odoroku-hodo reeseeni 

 	then and one-week fl self-for-also be.surprised-degree calmly 

	`For a week, surprisingly calmly,'
 . kensa-no kekka-o mati-masi-ta 

 	exam-gen result-o wait-plt-past 

	`I was waiting for the result of the medical exam.'
 . nde sono kensa-no kekka-wa hutuu-no hito-yori-mo sootoo izyoodat-ta-n-desu-ga 

 	and that exam-gen result-wa normal-gen person-than-also very abnormal-past-nmlz-cop-though 

 	`According to the result of the exam, the value was quite abnormal compared with common people,'
 . but it didn't pass the threshold that I could acquire the disease.
 (S02F0100: 662.61-677.85)





Unlike toiuno-wa,
wa also codes inferable elements extensively.
In ,
nyuusya `admission to a company' in line a triggers
siken `exam' in line c,
which is naturally coded by wa.

.siken . ee toaru ryokoo-sya-ni ano itioo nyuusya kimari-masi-ta 

		fl certain travel-company-dat fl tentatively admission decide-plt-past 

		`A certain travel company admitted me to work there.'
	. ...
	. hizyooni siken-wa muzukasikat-ta-to ima-mo oboe-teori-masu 

	very exam-wa difficult-past-quot now-also remember-prog-plt 

	`(I) still remember that the exam was very hard.' 

(S01F0038: 231.34-241.96)




Wa sometimes forces the hearer to accept the assumption that the hearer has already been thinking about the wa-coded referent;
I call this accommodation.
In , which immediately follows ,
wa which codes gyappu `gap' in line c
forces the hearer to accept the assumption that s/he expected the speaker to talk about the gap between the expectation and the reality.

. . tada soko-kara saki-wa ano dono sigoto-mo soo-da-to omou-n-desu-ga 

	but that-from ahead-wa fl which job-also so-cop-quot think-nmlz-plt 

	`But, after the admission, I guess this is the same in all kinds of jobs,'
	. yume-to genzitu-tte iu-n-desu-ka 

		dream-and reality-quot call-nmlz-plt-q 

		`people might call it (the difference between) dream and the reality,'
	. gyappu-wa kanari ari-masi-te 

			gap-wa very exist-plt-and 

			`there was a gap (between what I expected and the reality).'
(S01F0038: 265.11-270.98)




In cases like and ,
some hypothetical speakers might have chosen to use ga
instead of wa,
while wa cannot be replaced with ga
to code evoked elements in kebab and kensakekka.
If the elements were coded by ga in and ,
they do not force the hearer to accommodate the assumption that s/he has already been thinking about them.

What can be inferable depends on the culture.
In Japanese culture,
apartments might come with furniture such as a washing machine,
but not with livestock.
Therefore, as in [b],
wa coding sentaku-ki `washing machine' sounds natural,
while, as in [b],
wa coding hituzi `sheep' sounds strange
because it sounds as if the speaker assumed that it is common for a room to come with a sheep
and it is too difficult to accommodate oneself to this assumption.
.ExSentakuki
 . I'm looking for a new room and yesterday I saw one room.
 . sentaku-ki-wa/ga tui-te-ta-yo 

 	washing-machine-wa/ga come.with-prog-past-fp 

	`(The room) comes with a washing machine.'
 .[b.] hituzi-??wa/ga tui-te-ta-yo 

 	hituzi-wa/ga come.with-prog-past-fp 

	`(The room) comes with a sheep.'

Note that ga-coding is acceptable in both cases
because ga can code new elements.

kuroda72 and kuno73 argue that
generic NPs are always available as topics and
can be always coded by wa.
However, as I have discussed in Toiunowa,
not all generic NPs are available as topics.
Kuno's examples like may be natural at the beginning of speech.

. kuzira-wa honyuu-doobutu-desu 

      whale-top mammal-animal-cop.plt 

      `Speaking of whales, they are mammals. (A whale is a mammal.)'
      [44]kuno73

People can expect the speaker to start talking about kuzira `whales' out of the blue.
However, it is difficult to expect the speaker to talk about
``Kosovo War'' (S00M0199) and ``Himalaya trekking'' (S01F0151).
Therefore,
these NPs  are not naturally coded by wa out of the blue
even when they are in generic statements,
because they are not available as topics and are difficult to accommodate.
The speakers would choose other forms to introduce these NPs,
then might explain them in more detail in generic statements.
Out of 12 speeches I studied,
there is only one speech (S02M1698) where the speaker begins with a generic statement with toiuno-wa,
which is ExNingenToiunowa above.
The speaker begins with a generic statement about human beings in general,
which the hearer(s) can easily expect the speaker to start talking about out-of-the-blue.


So-called contrastive wa



I argue that so-called contrastive wa,
which has been discussed extensively in the literature [e.g.,][]kuno73,

is a special case for wa coding inferable elements.
In typical cases of inferables like siken,
the referent of one element (e.g., nyuusya `admission to a company') is evoked by an explicit mention and the referent of another related element (e.g., siken `exam') is partially evoked, triggered by the element explicitly mentioned;
`the admission' and `the exam' form a set relevant to the current discourse.
Similarly, the elements coded by contrastive wa
are assumed to belong to a set relevant to the current discourse.
In , which is slightly modified from ExSentakuki,
reezooko `fridge' and sentaku-ki `washing machine' belong to the same category of `things expected to come with a room'.
The `fridge' and the `washing machine' are contrasted
in the sense that
one is furnished but the other is not.

.
 . I'm looking for a new room and yesterday I saw one room.
 . reezooko-wa tui-te-nakat-ta-kedo sentaku-ki-wa tui-te-ta-yo 

 	fridge-wa come.with-prog-neg-past-though washing-machine-wa come.with-prog-past-fp 

	`Though (the room) doesn't come with a fridge, (it) comes with a washing machine.'

Note that wa coding hituzi `sheep' is still not natural in 
for the same reason as described in relation to ExSentakuki;
a sheep is not expected as a normal thing which is included with an apartment.

.
 . I'm looking for a new room and yesterday I saw one room.
 . ??reezooko-wa tui-te-nakat-ta-kedo hituzi-wa tui-te-ta-yo 

 	fridge-wa come.with-prog-neg-past-though sheep-wa come.with-prog-past-fp 

	`Though (the room) doesn't come with a fridge, (it) comes with a sheep.'

Similarly, in from our corpus,
the wa-coded elements tinomigo `infants' and inu `dogs' are contrasted.
They belong to the relevant category of `creatures that might not be allowed to enter restaurants'.

.
 . de doitu-toiu kuni-wa hizyooni ano uu inu-ni e sumi-yasui kuni-desu 

 	and Germany-quot nation-wa very fl fl dog-dat fl live-easy nation-cop.plt 

	`Germany is a dog-friendly country.'
 . tatoeba aa resutoran-de-mo anoo tinomigo-wa haire-nai-yoona resutoran-mo inu-wa haireru-to 

 	for.example fl restaurant-at-also fl infant-wa enter.can-neg-such.as restaurant-also dog-wa enter.can-quot 

 	`For example, restaurants where infants are not allowed to get in, uh, dogs can get in them.'
	(S02M1698: 243.46-256.10)





[p. 44 ff.]kuno73 points out that
the contrastively wa-coded elements are not necessarily anaphoric (given),
while the non-contrastively wa-coded elements are.
However, there is a problem with this claim.
It is possible for non-contrastively wa-coded elements to be non-anaphoric;
they can be inferable as we have seen in the previous section.
If what Kuno means by ``anaphoric'' includes bridging anaphora clark75 and thus includes inferable elements,
then contrastively wa-coded elements are also anaphoric,
because the elements belong to the same category relevant to the current discourse.
I argue that the distinction between contrastive and non-contrastive is continuous and a matter of degree;
if there are more than two evoked referents in the same category,
they tend to be contrastive,
while if there is only one element,
it is non-contrastive.













Declining and unused elements tend not to be coded by waPar:Wa:DecUnusedWa

Declining elements cannot be coded by wa.
For example, in sigoto, which is repeated here as for convenience,
`job' is intervened by another topic `fame'.
When the speaker goes back to `job',
it is not natural for wa to code the element `job'.

.
 . I have two goals: one is for fame and the other is for job.
 . Concerning fame,
 . I have been participating in various piano competitions
 . So far the best award I received was the fourth best play in the China-Japan International Competition.
 . Beyond that, I would like to receive higher awards.
 . Titles matter a lot for pianists, so I will work hard.
 . de ato-wa sigoto-no bubun-nan-desu-keredomo/(??-wa) 

 	then remaining-wa job-gen part-nmlz-cop.plt-though/-wa 

	`Concerning the other one, job,'
 . to receive higher wages...
(S00F0209: 495.77-539.19)
















Similarly,
unused elements cannot be coded by wa,
as the contrast between and shows.
These examples are repeated from FacebookParty and Party.

. Context: According to Facebook, both A and B are going to a party tomorrow. But they have not seen each other for a week. A sees B in a classroom and talks to B:
	.[A:] asita-no paathii-da-kedo/??-wa roku-zi-kara-da-yo-ne 

		tomorrow-gen party-cop-though/toiuno-wa six-o'clock-from-cop-fp-fp 

		`Tomorrow's party is from six, right?' 


. Context: A and B are having a conversation. B mentioned the party tomorrow, which A knows that both A and B are going to.
	.[A:] asita-no paathii-??da-kedo/-wa roku-zi-kara-da-yo-ne 

		tomorrow-gen party-cop-though/toiuno-wa six-o'clock-from-cop-fp-fp 

		`Tomorrow's party is from six, right?' 












Although many scholars discuss wa based on examples like ,
which appears to be produced out-of-the-blue,
they are unnatural in spoken Japanese.

. ??anoo toire-wa doko-desu-ka 

	fl bathroom-wa where-cop.plt-q 

	`Excuse me, where is the bathroom?'

Assuming that is produced out-of-the-blue without previous mention of the bathroom,
the best marker is O.
It seems that in written Japanese,
wa can be used to code unused elements as shown in ,
assuming that this is written Japanese (in an e-mail or letter).

. tokorode kono aida ohanasi si-tei-ta eega-wa totemo omosirokat-ta-desu 

	by.the.way this interval speech do-prog-past movie
 very interesting-past-plt 

 `By the way, the movie I mentioned the other day was very interesting.'

The spoken Japanese version of is not natural, as shown in .

. ?a kono aida hanasi-te-ta eega-wa totemo omosirokat-ta-desu-yo 

	oh this interval talk-prog-past movie
 very interesting-past-plt-fp 

 `By the way, the movie I mentioned the other day was very interesting.'

Formal speech is closer to written Japanese than casual speech
and the boundary between them is blurred.
Note, however, that
the conceptual space is a suitable format to capture variations like this [see][]croft10.


The copula followed by ga or kedokedo

A combination of a copula followed by ga or kedo
codes declining or unused elements.
As has been mentioned above,
there are not many examples of these topic markers in the corpus
and I will mainly employ grammatical judgements of constructed and actual examples
and analyze them qualitatively rather than quantitatively.
The results are compatible with the claims in koide84 and takahashi99,
which supports the conclusion of this chapter.
As discussed in BackSubSubKedo,
they argue that ga newly introduces topics in the beginning of a discourse.

There are variations of both copulas and ga or kedo.
Copulas can be da or desu.
Desu is more polite than da,
and it appears more frequently in our corpus.
This is a natural consequence of the nature of the corpus;
the speakers are not familiar with their listeners.
There are no remarkable variations of ga,
while there are some variations of kedo:
keredomo and kedomo.
In the following sections,
I will sometimes call this marker kedo.
Keep in mind, however, that there are variations of kedo as well as copulas preceding it.


Evoked and inferable elements cannot be coded by the copula followed by ga or kedo

Evoked elements cannot be coded by kedo.
This is exemplified in ,
where `ice cream' that H had kept in the fridge is assumed to be evoked in H's mind by speaker Y.
It is appropriate to assume that the referent `ice cream' is evoked in H's mind
because H opens the fridge.

. Context: Y knows that H, his roommate, keeps ice cream in the fridge
	but saw Taro, another roommate, eat all of H's ice cream after H had left for school.
	When H came back and opens the freezer,
	Y wants to tell the fact.
	.[Y:] aisu-??da-kedo/wa taroo-ga tabe-tyat-ta-yo 

		ice.cream-cop-though/top Taro-ga eat-pfv-past-fp 

		`Taro ate up (your) ice cream.'




In a similar way,
inferable elements cannot be coded by the marker
as shown in ,
where `ice cream' is assumed to be inferable because they are talking about the things in the fridge and both of them know that there was ice cream there.

. Context:
	Y and H are roommates and check what is remaining in the fridge.
	.[H:] I'm sure that there are still rice cakes remaining.
	.[Y:] un demo aisu-??da-kedo/wa taroo-ga tabe-tyat-ta-yo 

		yeah but ice.cream-cop-though/wa Taro-ga eat-pfv-past-fp 

		`Yeah, but Taro ate up (your) ice cream.'



Declining and unused elements can be coded by the copula followed by ga or kedo

Declining elements can be coded by kedo.
As discussed above,
there is no simple way to identify declining elements.
The declining status appears to be related to intervention of other topics;
when the speaker shifts one topic to another topic and mentions the first one again,
the first topic is considered to be declining.
In the following example ,
the speaker introduced the first (fame) and the second (job) topics at the same time in line a.
She talks about the first one from line b-f,
then moves on to the second one in line g,
where the second topic (job) is considered to be declining.

.sigoto2
 . I have two goals: one is for fame and the other is for job.
 . Concerning fame,
 . I have been participating in various piano competitions.
 . So far the best award I received was the fourth best play in the China-Japan International Competition.
 . Beyond that, I would like to receive higher awards.
 . Titles matter a lot for pianists, so I will work hard.
 . de ato-wa sigoto-no bubun-nan-desu-keredomo 

 	then remaining-wa job-gen part-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

	`Concerning the other one, job,'
 . to receive higher wages...
(S00F0209: 495.77-534.04)
















As discussed in Toiuno-waInfSemiActUnuse,
`tea time' in the example thii-taimu, repeated here as , is not established as a topic yet (and hence cannot be coded by toiuno-wa).
This kind of referent can also be coded by kedo.
Kedo is able to upgrade the referent to the topic status.

.thii-taimu2
 . While we trek on the Everest Trail, the cook makes us lunch in a way,
 . in addition, there is tea time and we can take a break while we climb the mountain,
 . so, we walked without feeling that we were in a big group.
 . de kono thii-taimu-nan-desu-keredomo 

		and this tea-time-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

		`And at this tea time,'

		this elevation-gen high place-loc-wa altitude.sickness-quot very dangerous possibility-ga exist-because 

		`this place of high elevation, there is a possibility of altitude sickness, so...'
 . ee mizu-ga hizyooni zyuuyooni nari-masu 

		fl water-ga very important become-plt 

		`water is very important.'
		 (S01F0151: 323.00-349.56)









There is only one non-anaphoric element coded by kedo as in ,
while the other six examples are anaphoric.
In ,
the speaker has been talking about travel to Hawaii,
then she mentions `the traveling style',
which is coded by kedo.
. . nde ee kono tabi-no sutairu-tteiu-mono-nan-desu-keredomo 

		and fl this travel-gen style-called-thing-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

		`And regarding this traveling style'
	. anoo watasi-wa moo kekkoo ma tabi-nare-teru-to iu-ka 

		fl 1.sg-wa fl to.some.extent fl travel-is.used.to-quot say-q 

		`I'm used to travel to some extent, so to speak...'
		(S00F0014: 300.43-309.95)




This kind of example may be considered to be inferable;
traveling is associated with its style.
However, the association might be too weak.
I categorize this example as a marginal case of inferable
and kedo functions to upgrade the referent to the topic status.

Unused elements can be coded by kedo,
as shown in .
In ,
it is assumed that speaker Y and hearer H share a particular ice cream
but it is not evoked in H's mind
because s/he is just in school.

. aisuTContext: Y knows that H, Y's roommate, keeps ice cream in the fridge
	but saw Taro, another roommate, eat all of H's ice cream after H had left for school.
	Y wants to tell H this fact when Y sees H in school.
	.[Y:] sooieba aisu-da-kedo/??wa taro-ga tabe-tyat-ta-yo 

		by.the.way ice.cream-cop-though/top Taro-ga eat-pfv-past-fp 

		`By the way, Taro ate up (your) ice cream.'




























Further analysis of the copula followed by ga or kedo

The above examples of kedo might be considered to be clauses rather than phrases
because ga and kedo are subordinate-clause markers.
In ,
kedo (realized as keredomo) is a subordinate-clause marker;
the clause has the subject pointo `point' and the predicate kirauea-kazan `Kilauea'.
Thus all the examples of topics coded by kedo above might also be the predicates of copula clauses.

. . sono hawai-too-no ma kankoo-no itiban sono ookina pointo-tteiuno-ga kirauea-kazan-nan-desu-keredomo 

		fl Hawaii-island-gen fl sightseeing-gen most fl big point-toiuno-ga Kilauea-volcano-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

		`The biggest sightseeing point on Hawaii island is Kilauea...'
	. anoo kirauea-kazan-mo mappu-o kai-masi-te de zibun-tati-de ma renta-kaa-o tobasi-te e iki-masi-ta 

	fl Kilauea-volcano-also map-o buy-plt-and and self-pl-by fl rent.a-car-o drive-and fl go-plt-past 

	`(We) bought a map, drove a rental car, and went to Kilauea by ourselves.'
		(S00F0014: 836.05-850.16)

However, there are differences between examples like [a]
and topics coded by kedo discussed in preceding sections,
as was mentioned in BackSubSubKedo.
First,
it is actually impossible to ``recover'' the subject of alleged copula clauses in topic-coding kedo,
while it is possible in general for the copula predicate followed by kedo to have a subject.
For example,
one cannot ``recover'' the subject of the alleged copula clause aisuT,
while examples like [a] do have a subject.
Therefore,
the former is considered to be a kind of phrase,
whereas the latter is a kind of clause.

Second,
topic elements coded by kedo are presupposed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer,
while predicates of copula clauses followed by kedo like are not presupposed to be shared.
This is supported by the hee test.
As shown in , kedo-coded topics cannot be repeated as news preceded by hee `oh, really'.

. .[A:]
 . sono rukura-no mura-nan-desu-ga 

   that Lukla-gen village-nmlz-cop-though 

   `Regarding that village, Lukla,'
  . hikoozyoo-wa hontooni yama-no naka-ni ari-masi-te 

    airport-wa really mountain-gen inside-dat exist-plt-and 

    `the airport was really in a mountainous area...'
    (S01F0151: 187.33-191.39)
   .
   .[B:] ??hee, rukura-no mura 

     Oh, Lukla village.





On the other hand,
the predicate of copula clauses followed by kedo can be repeated as news, as shown in .

. .[A:] sono hawai-too-no ma kankoo-no itiban sono ookina pointo-tteiuno-ga kirauea-kazan-nan-desu-keredomo 

		fl Hawaii-island-gen fl sightseeing-gen most fl big point-toiuno-ga Kilauea-volcano-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

		`The biggest sightseeing point on Hawaii island is Kilauea...'



		(S00F0014: 836.05-842.87)

	.[B:] hee, kirauea-kazan-nan-da 

	  Oh Kilauea-volcano-nmlz-cop  

	  `Oh, Kilauea volcano.'
	  (Constructed)


Although these two kinds of kedo are distinct,
they are related to each other.
[Chapter 9]niwa06 argues that
ga-coded subordinate clauses state background of the main clause and
that this use of subordinate ga grammaticalizes into topic marker.
However, historical investigations are necessary to support this claim
and I leave it open for future studies.



TopZero

As mentioned earlier,
the zero particles do not appear frequently in our corpus
because of the stylistic difference.
As a result,
most examples in this section are constructed rather than naturally produced.

There are two kinds of zero particles:
a topic-coding zero particle () and a focus-coding zero particle ().
There are at least three differences, as summarized in [see also][]niwa06,nakagawasato12.

.

 (c) & followed by accentual boundary & coherent intonation contour

tabular

The elements coded by  are by definition assumed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer.
Also, they precede other arguments and are followed by the accentual-phrase boundary.
On the other hand,
those coded by  are by definition assumed not to be shared between the speaker and the hearer.
They appear close to the predicate and are not followed by the accentual-phrase boundary;
rather, they are produced in a single intonation contour with the predicate.
As shown by the contrast between and ,
the element nezumi `mouse' preceding another argument neko `cat' is felicitous when the speaker and the hearer share the referent in question as in [Y],
while it is not when they do not share the referent as in [Y].
On the other hand,
the element `mouse' adjacent to the predicate tukamae-ta `caught' is felicitous when they do not share the referent as in [Y],
while it is not when they share the referent as in [Y].

. Context: Y and H are roommates,
	who are bothered by a mouse running around their room
	and eating their leftovers.
	They set a trap to catch the mouse.
	But the cat they keep caught the mouse while H was out.

	Y wants to let H know this news.

Similarly,
[Chapter 10]niwa06 reports that topical elements such as
ano ko `that girl' and ree-no seerusuman `the salesman' are felicitously zero-coded clause-initially,
as the contrasts between [a--b] and [a--b] show.

      `Yesterday that salesman came (here), apparently.'
      (ibid.)


On the other hand, focal elements such as kawaii ko `a cute girl' and dokokano seerusuman `a salesman' are not felicitously zero-coded clause-initially, as the contrasts between [a--b] and [a--b] show.

.
 . oi keiri-ka-ni sugoi kawaii ko-ga/O hait-ta-zo 

      hey accounting-section-dat very cute girl-ga/O enter-past-fp

      `Hey, a very cute girl joined the accounting section.'
 . oi sugoi kawaii ko-ga/?O keiri-ka-ni hait-ta-zo

      `Hey, a very cute girl joined the accounting section.'
      (ibid.)

.

      yesterday somewhere-gen salesman-ga/O come-past-infr-cop-fp

      `Yesterday a salesman came (here), apparently.'
      (ibid.)










Note that wa is unnatural in all of the examples Par:Ex:Anoko through 
although I interpret these elements as topics.
As I have discussed in Wa,
wa codes elements referring to evoked or inferable entities.
Ano ko `that girl' in Par:Ex:Anoko and ree-no seerusuman `the salesman' in Par:Ex:Seerusuman are unused.
Hence, wa-coding is unnatural in this case;
instead, ga-coding is natural.
The question which naturally arises is whether these elements are actually topics.
I argue that unused elements are ambiguous between topic and focus.
They are topics in the sense that the referent in question is shared between the speaker and the hearer via shared knowledge or common sense;
they are foci in the sense that it is newly introduced into the discourse.


Throughout this section,
I mainly discuss P (the patient-like argument in transitive clauses) preceding A (the agent-like argument in transitive clauses)
because it is clear that they are preposed,
which tend to be topics,
as we will see in Chapter WordOrder.




Evoked, inferable, declining, and unused elements can be coded by 

Evoked elements can be coded by ,
as exemplified in ,
where `mouse' is assumed to be evoked in H's mind
because H is looking at the trap to catch a mouse.
In this case, wa-coding is also natural.

. Context: Y and H are roommates,
	who are bothered by a mouse running around their room
	and eating their leftovers.
	They set a trap to catch the mouse.
	But the cat they keep caught the mouse while H was out.
	When H is back and looks at the inside of the trap,
	Y wants to let H know this news.
	.[Y:] nezumi-O/wa, neko-ga tukamae-ta-yo 

		nezumi-O/wa cat-ga catch-past-fp 

		`The cat caught (the) mouse.' (Evoked topic P)

This judgement might be too subtle for some readers.
Here I am assuming that H is thinking about the mouse because s/he is checking the trap right now.
Given this assumption, Y can felicitously use wa as well as zero-coding.

Inferable elements can also be coded by ,
as shown in .
Hyoosi `(book) cover' is used instead of nezumi `mouse',
which is easily associated with a book and is assumed to be inferable from the book mentioned earlier.
Again, wa-coding is also natural in this case.

. Context: Y borrowed a book from H and wants to return it.
 .[Y1:] Thank you for the book. It was interesting.
 .[Y2:] hyoosi-/wa neko-ga yabui-tyat-ta gomen 

   cover-/wa cat-ga break-pfv-past sorry 

   `The cat broke the cover. Sorry.' (Inferable topic P)






Declining elements can be coded by 
as shown in ,
where `mouse' is assumed to be declining.
The mouse belongs to the speaker and is mentioned first in [-Y2].
Then the speaker mentions the cat in [-Y3-4],
and again mentions the mouse in [-Y5], which is assumed to be declining.

.
 .[Y1:] A cat was chasing our mouse.
 .[Y2:] The mouse ran really quickly.
 .[Y3:] But the cat was also running very fast.
 .[Y4:] The cat seemed to be hungry.
 .[Y5:] de kekkyoku uti-no nezumi-/wa/??da-kedo neko-ga tukamae-tyat-ta-yo 

   and eventually our-gen mouse-/wa/cop-though cat-ga catch-pfv-past-fp 

   `Finally the cat caught our mouse.' (Declining topic P)

In this example [-Y5],
the passive version is preferable to an active version like [-Y5]
because the mouse belongs to the speaker but the cat does not.
I will discuss this issue further in association with subjecthood in Par:ArgStr.

Moreover,
wa is acceptable and kedo is not acceptable in [-Y5]
contrary to the generalization in Table ParInfoStatusT.
I suspect that this is because the referent `mouse' is the center of the speaker's interest;
the mouse is still evoked,
which causes wa, rather than da-kedo to be natural.

Unused elements can be coded by ,
as exemplified in ,
where the referent `mouse' is assumed to be unused
because there is no clear evidence that H is thinking about the mouse at the time of utterance,
though Y and H share the mouse that bothers them.

. UnusedMouseContext: Y and H are roommates,
	who are bothered by a mouse running around their room
	and eating their leftovers.
	The cat they keep finally caught the mouse while H was out.
	When H is back, Y wants to let H know this news.
	.[Y:] nezumi-O/??wa/da-kedo, neko-ga tukamae-ta-yo 

		nezumi-O/wa/cop-though cat-ga catch-past-fp 

		`The cat caught (the) mouse.' (Unused topic P)



Difference between  and explicit forms

In addition to the stylistic difference,
there are further differences between  and explicit forms such as toiuno-wa, wa, and kedo.
First,
the functional category of the topic element within a clause is less clear when the topic is coded by explicit markers,
while the category needs to be clear
if the topic is zero-coded.
For example, in ,
where thii-taimu `tea time' is originally coded by kedo,
`tea time' and the following clause are only vaguely connected
and the status of the topic element in terms of grammatical function (such as subject or object) within the clauses is not clear.
In this case, coding elements by  is difficult.

. . de kono thii-taimu-nan-desu-keredomo/(??) 

		and this tea-time-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

		`And at this tea time,'
	. kono hyookoo-no takai tokoro-de-wa koozanbyoo-toiu hizyooni kikennna kanoosee-ga aru-node 

		this elevation-gen high place-loc-wa altitude.sickness-quot very dangerous possibility-ga exist-because 

		`this place of high elevation, there is a possibility of altitude sickness, so...'
	. ee mizu-ga hizyooni zyuuyooni nari-masu 

		fl water-ga very important become-plt 

		`water is very important.'
		 (S01F0151: 339.78-349.56)






Another difference between zero-coded elements and explicitly coded elements is whether backchannel responses such as un `yeah' are possible right after the production of the topic element in question.
For example, in UnusedMouse, repeated here as ,
it is difficult to insert a backchannel response such as un `yeah' after nezumi-,
but it is possible after nezumi-da-kedo.

. Context: Y and H are roommates,
	who are bothered by a mouse running around their room
	and eating their leftovers.
	The cat they keep finally caught the mouse while H was out.
	When H is back, Y wants to let H know this news.
	.[Y:] nezumi-O/da-kedo, neko-ga tukamae-ta-yo 

		nezumi-O/cop-though cat-ga catch-past-fp 

		`The cat caught (the) mouse.' (=UnusedMouse)

This suggests that the speaker assesses through kedo the hearer's state of knowledge,
i.e., whether the hearer can recall the referent of the kedo-coded element that is supposed to be shared between the speaker and the hearer,
while this assessment effect is weaker in zero-coding.



Summary of topic markers

The findings of topic codings are summarized in Table ParInfoStatusT,
repeated here as Table ParInfoStatusT3 for convenience.
The results indicate that topics are heterogeneous,
but at the same time, can be accounted for in terms of the given-new taxonomy.
Closer analyses also revealed that the given-new taxonomy is continuous and there are borderline cases.

The characteristics of toiuno-wa
discussed in Toiunowa
are a combination of
the descriptions of masuokatakubo92 and takubo89.
The statements that include toiuno-wa-coded elements describe the general characteristics of the referents.
Although it is not always the case that the speaker assumes that the hearer does not know the referent in question,
the speaker might assume that s/he knows more about it than the hearer.
For example, in ,
hawai `Hawaii' is coded by toiuno-wa,
where I do not believe that
the speaker assumes that the hearer(s) do(es) not know Hawaii
because it is too famous.
However, the speaker might assume that she knows more about Hawaii than the hearer(s).

. hawai-toiuno-wa ma nihon-zin-ga totemo suki-de 

	Hawaii-toiuno-wa fl Japan-person-ga very like-and 

	`Hawaii, Japanese people love it.'
	(S00F0014: 1145.00-1147.55)



In addition to the characteristics the previous literature has pointed out,
this study found that
the toiuno-wa-coded elements tend to be evoked at the time of utterance
and tend to be mentioned repeatedly in the following discourse;

toiuno-wa codes important topics.

The discussion in Wa showed that
wa codes elements referring to entities which are
evoked or inferable through related elements.
This is not only compatible with, but also elaborates the observation that
wa codes elements that have been ``entered into the registry of the present discourse'' [45]kuno73.
I provided the cognitive model which well captures the distribution of wa-coding and showed the range of wa-coding:
what can be and cannot be coded by wa.
This chapter also provided an unified account for wa-coding in general,
i.e., wa-coding including generic and contrastive wa.
Of course, further empirical investigations are necessary to test whether the observations proposed here are supported or not.

The discussion in kedo supports the previous observation of this topic expression;
the expression is used to newly introduce topics in the beginning of a discourse or a paragraph koide84,takahashi99.
I re-examined this observation in terms of the given-new taxonomy.

The discussion in TopZero distinguished topic vs. focus zero particles,
following niwa06 and nakagawasato12,
This section investigated the topic zero particles and made it clear
that they can code elements referring to all entities in the given-new taxonomy
if the entities are shared between the speaker and the hearer.
































































Case markersCasePar

While topic markers code topics of different statuses in the given-new taxonomy as discussed in the previous section,
I will argue in this section that
elements coded by case markers ga and o are foci.
For example in ,
the ga-coded element doobutu-aigo-kyookai `animal shelters' and
the o-coded elements kihu `donation' and koto `thing'
can be repeated as news after hee.

.
 .[A:]
 . amerika-de-wa anoo doobutu-aigo-kyookai-ga 

   America-loc-wa fl animal-protection-association-ga 

   `In America, animal shelters'
  . a ee kurisumasu-no mae-ni-wa sono doneesyon kihu-o si-te 

   fl fl Christmas-gen before-dat-wa fl donation donation-o do-and 

   `let (people) donate before Christmas and'
  . maa aa ip-piki mot-teku-toiu koto-o yat-te ori-masi-te 

   fl fl one-cl have-go-quot thing-o do-and prog-plt-and 

   `take one, (they) were doing this kind of thing.'
   (S02M1698: 115.54-126.38)
  .
  .[B:] hee, doobutu-aigo-kyookai-ga/kihu-o/sonna koto-o 

   Oh, animal shelters/donation/such a thing



It has been pointed out by many scholars that
elements coded by case markers in Japanese are foci.
lambrecht94, for instance, argues that ga is appropriate for focal elements
and not appropriate for topical elements.
For example,
compare and .
In ,
where the speaker's neck is presupposed to be at issue at the time of utterance [A],
only wa-coding is natural,
although zero pronoun is more natural in this context.

. .[Q:] How's your neck?
	.[A:] [kubi-??ga/wa] itai] 

			neck-ga/wa hurt 

			`My neck HURTS.' [p.137]lambrecht94

In ,
on the other hand,
where the speaker's neck is not presupposed to be at issue at the time of utterance [A],
ga-coding is more natural than wa-coding.
. .[Q:] What's the matter?
	.[A:] [kubi-ga/??wa [itai] 

			neck-ga/wa hurt 

			`My NECK HURTS.' (ibid.)


In the following sections,
I will discuss focus coding mainly by means of case particles including zero ().
The distribution of particles is summarized in Table OvertZeroCaseParT (repeated from Table OvertZeroCaseParT1),
where A indicates the agent-like argument of a transitive clause,
S indicates the only argument of intransitive clause, and
P indicates the patient-like argument of a transitive clause comrie78,dixon79.
Since zero-coding typically appears only in casual speech,
the main source for the generalization in Table OvertZeroCaseParT
comes from grammaticality judgements.

Note that Table OvertZeroCaseParT is also a kind of semantic map;
a scale of agentivity on the one hand
and that of contrastiveness on the other.
Here I categorize argument focus together with contrastive focus
to refer to ``contrastive focus''
because, as long as ga/o vs. zero-coding is concerned, argument and contrastive focus do not differ from each other;
ga/o overtly codes argument and contrastive focus (of P and patient S),
whereas zero-coding is preferred elsewhere.

I argue that
the Semantic Map Connectivity Hypothesis SemanticMapHypIS applies to this table:
the category that each the marker codes should map onto a connected region in conceptual space.
In the following sections,
I will discuss each case particle.

As has been mentioned earlier,
there are few zero particles in the corpus because of the style of this corpus, and the majority of discussions in this section also rely on grammaticality judgements rather than corpus studies or other experimental methods.
  
 This section is based on part of the discussion in nakagawa13m.
 


GaPar:CasePar:Ga

This section considers the marker ga.
I distinguish ga coding A and S, and ga in the argument- and sentence-focus environment.


Ga coding focus A

Focus A requires ga regardless of
whether the element in question is contrastive or not.
As exemplified in ,
only ga-coding is natural and o- and zero-codings are not natural
to code non-contrastive focus A.

.ExfocusAa neko-ga/*o/??O/ nezumi oikake-teru 

	oh cat-ga/o/O mouse chase-prog 

	`Look! A cat is chasing a mouse.' (Non-contrastive focus A)

Unnaturalness of zero-coding in is not necessarily because
A is not adjacent to the predicate.
As shown in ,
where the A is adjacent to the predicate,
zero-coding is still not natural
and only ga-coding is natural.

. .[Q:] Do you know where my mouse is?
	.[A:] neko-ga/*o/??O oikake-te-ta-yo 

		cat-ga/o/O chase-prog-past-fp 

		`The cat was chasing it.' (Non-contrastive focus A)

Contrastive focus (or argument focus) A is only naturally coded by ga
and other markers are not natural.
This is exemplified in ,
where only neko `cat' rather than the whole clause is the domain of focus.

.
	.[Q:] What is chasing a mouse?
	.[A:] neko-ga/*o/??O nezumi oikake-teru-yo 

	cat-ga/o/O mouse chase-prog-fp 

	`A cat is chasing a mouse.' (Contrastive focus A)








Ga coding focus S

Agent S is obligatorily coded by ga,
while patient S can be coded by either ga or ,
when S is non-contrastive focus,
which has already been pointed out in [56-57]kageyama93.
As shown by the contrast between and ,
agent S is naturally coded by ga,
but not o or  as in ,
while patient S can be naturally coded by either ga or ,
but not o as in .

.ExAgentS
	. a neko-ga/*o/?? arui-teru 

	oh cat-ga/o/ walk-prog 

	`Look! A cat is walking!'
	. a kodomo-ga/*o/?? ason-deru 

		oh child-ga/o/ play-prog 

		`Look! A child is playing.' (Non-contrastive focus S (agent))

.ExPatientS
	. a saihu-ga/*o/ oti-teru 

		oh purse-ga/o/ 

		`Look! A purse is on the road! (Lit: A purse has fallen (and it's there).)'
	. a kanban-ga/*o/ taore-teru 

		oh sign-ga/o/ fall-prog 

		`Look! A sign has fallen (and it is lying).' (Non-contrastive focus S (patient))


Contrastive S is always coded by ga
regardless of whether S is agent or patient.

.
 .[Q:] What is walking over there?
 .[A:] neko-ga/*o/?? arui-teru yo 

	cat-ga/o/ walk-prog fp 

	`A cat is walking.' (Contrastive focus S (agent))

. .[Q:] What has fallen?
	.[A:] saihu-ga/*o/?? oti-ta-yo 

			wallet-ga/o/ fall-past-fp 

			`The wallet has fallen.' (Contrastive focus S (patient))

Note that
it is more natural to code non-contrastive focus animate patient S by ga rather than , as exemplified in .

. ExAnimateS
	. a kodomo-ga/*o/??O taore-teru 

		oh child-ga/o/O fall-prog 

		`Look! A child has fallen (and he is lying).'
	. a anna tokoro-ni kodomo/neko-ga/*o/?O iru 

		oh such place-dat child/cat-ga/o/O exist 

		`Look! A child/cat is in that kind of (dangerous) place.' (Non-contrastive focus S (patient  animate))



Ga coding animate elements?Par:CasePar:Ga:GaAnim

Some might think that the choice between ga vs.  is sensitive to animacy rather than agentivity.
As has been discussed in Chapter Introduction, I rather take the view that a single marker can code complex features;
the marker ga codes focus, agent, and animate elements
and one cannot determine a single feature that ga codes.
comrie79 calls this seepage.
In Hindi,
for example,
the postposition ko codes definite or animate (especially human) direct object,
while other kinds of direct objects tend to be zero-coded.
There is no simple correlation of ko with either animate or definite direct object.
In the following example ,
where do stands for `direct object marker',
sometimes ko codes animate elements, as in [a] but sometimes not, as in [c],
and it sometimes codes definite elements, as in [c] but sometimes not, as in [a,d].
Therefore,
it is difficult to decide on a single feature that ko codes.
Rather,
as comrie79 argues,
ko codes complex features of animacy, definiteness, and direct object.
.
 . aurat bacce ko bula rahi hai 

	woman child do calling prog is 

	`The woman is calling the/a child.' (animate DO)



 . darzi O bulao 

	tailor O call 

	`Call a tailor.' (animate indefinite DO)
 . un patrom ko parhie 

	those letters do read (POL) 

	`Please read those letters.' (definite DO)
 . ye patr O parhie 

	these letters O read (POL) 

	`Please read these letters' (inanimate definite DO)



flushright
[][p. 48]mcgregor72
flushright

In the same sense that ko codes complex features,
I argue that ga codes complex features
of agent, animacy, and focus.
First,
ga, but not , codes inanimate A.
For example, in ,
makku `Mac(intosh)' in [a] and baketu `bucket' in [b]
are inanimate As
and can only be coded by ga;
 is unnatural in this context.
Therefore, in addition to animacy,
ga is also sensitive to agentivity.

. ExInanimateA
 . a makku-ga/?O koe dasi-ta 

  oh Mac-ga/O koe produce-past 

  `Wow, a Mac produced voice!'
 . a baketu-ga/?O doa osae-teru 

  oh bucket-ga/O door hold-prog 

  `Oh a bucket holds the door (and this is why the door won't close).'
   (Inanimate A)


Ga coding non-nominative focusPar:CasePar:Ga:GaFoc

Ga also codes non-nominative focus.
For example, 
poteto-tippusu-to `with potato chips' in [a] and
ima-made `before now'
are non-nominative,
as is shown in the translation;
however, they are coded by ga.

.ExNon-ArgFocus
 . koora-wa poteto-tippusu-to-ga au-n-da-yo 

   cola-wa potato-chip-with-ga match-nmlz-cop-fp 

   `Cola (especially) goes well with POTATO CHIPS.'
     
    This nice example was suggested by Yuji Togo.
    
 . tanni ima-made-ga samuku-nakat-ta-dake-mitai 

   simply now-from-ga cold-neg-past-just-apparently 

   `It simply looks like BEFORE NOW was not cold (and now it's cold).'
 (Focus non-nominative)

Similarly,
guratan-ni `for gratin' in [B] is not an argument of the predicate
but is still coded by ga.

. .[A:] I thought that you didn't like penne.
	.[B:] penne-wa guratan-ni-ga ii-n-da-yo 

	penne-wa gratin-for-ga good-nmlz-cop-fp 

	`Penne is good for GRATIN.' (Contrastive focus non-nominative)

The following examples are from a comic book and the Internet.
One can find many examples of ga-coding non-nominative on the Internet.
Note, however, that
especially [b] is not acceptable to some people.

.
 . koko-kara-ga hontoo-no zigoku-da

       (Common warning by school teachers)
        
       I found 32,700 websites using this expression with Google exact search (searched on 06/17/2015).
       


There are examples of ga coding non-nominative focus
in actual spoken data.
The following examples are from the Chiba three-party conversation corpus Den_2007_SAC,
which includes more casual conversations than CSJ.
In ,
sono hoo `that way' is marked by ga even though okane `money' is the only argument of the intransitive predicate kakaru `to take (time) or to cost'.
The speaker compares buying a computer with other options,
and claims that buying a computer costs more.
Buying a computer is interpreted as focus and is coded by ga,
while money is S.

. sono hoo-ga okane-O kakaru-zyan 

	that way-ga money-O required.intr-fp 

	`More money costs in THAT way (i.e., if you buy a computer).' (chiba0232: 400.32-401.43)

In ,
after listening to an angry story of another participant,
the speaker claims that it is the speaker himself (and the other participant) that were angry in this story.
hara `belly' is the only argument of the intransitive predicate tatu `stand'.
hara tatu `belly stands' is an idiomatic expression meaning `to be angry'.
In this example,
however,
ore-tati `we' is coded by ga
because it is focused.
. are-wa musiro ore-tati-ga hara-O tat-ta-yo-ne 

	that-wa rather 1sg-pl-ga belly-O stand.intr-past-fp-fp 

	`In that event, WE got angry (rather than you).' (chiba0432: 111.64-113.37)

These examples are the cases where ga purely codes focus:
ga codes neither agent nor animate elements.


To summarize,
ga sometimes codes animate patient S like ExAnimateS,
sometimes codes non-animate agent like ExInanimateA,
sometimes codes non-nominative inanimate focus elements, as in ExNon-ArgFocus to , and,
probably more frequently,
it codes elements with complex features of agentivity, animacy, and focus.
Like ko in Hindi,
ga codes multiple features
and it is difficult and not necessary to determine a single feature that ga codes.



O


O coding focus P

Non-contrastive focus P is usually zero-coded,
while contrastive focus P is only naturally coded by o.
This is shown by the contrast between and .
In ,
where the question elicits a broad focus structure,
zero-coding is the most natural option,
while ga- and o-codings are less natural.

.ExfocusP
	.[Q:] What do you do?
	.[A:] tetugaku-*ga/?o/ benkyoo si-te-n-da-yo 

		philosophy-ga/o/ study do-prog-nmlz-decl-fp 

		`I study philosophy.'

In ,
on the other hand,
where the question elicits a narrow focus structure,
overt o-coding is more natural than ga- and zero-codings.

. 
	.[Q:] What do you study?
	.[A:] tetugaku-*ga/o/?? benkyoo si-teru-n-da-yo 

		philosophy-ga/o/ study do-prog-nmlz-decl-fp 

		`I study philosophy.'


Some native speakers of Japanese might find o-coding in not unnatural, contrary to my claim.
I argue that o-marking of non-contrastive focus in casual conversation
is limited to theatric speech.
According to nakagawa13m,
who studied a casual spoken corpus of manzai
(a popular stand-up comedy performed by two people),
75 (222 examples) of 297 P-codings are zero-coding,
while only 25 (75 examples) are o-coding.
Although this corpus survey does not distinguish contrastive vs. non-contrastive foci,
it is clear from this survey that
the vast majority of P-coding in casual spoken Japanese is O.




FocZero

As discussed in the previous sections on ga and o,
non-contrastive focus P and patient S are coded by .
As shown in ExfocusA,
non-contrastive focus A can only naturally be coded by ga,
and zero-coding is not natural.
As discussed in relation to examples ExAgentS and ExPatientS,
non-contrastive agent S can only naturally be coded by ga, but not O,
while non-contrastive patient S can be coded by either ga or O.
As shown in ExfocusP,
non-contrastive P can only naturally be coded by O.


Summary of case markers

The distribution of case markers including the zero particles is summarized in Table OvertZeroCaseParT.
This study revealed the distributions of case particles and the zero particles in term of information structure.
The previous literature was not clear about the relationships between the twofold characteristics of ga:
nominative and exhaustive listing vs. neutral description.
Following comrie79,
the study proposed that
a single particle has multiple features at the same time.
The particles ga and o are used in the focus environment;
at the same time, they indicate the functional relation of the element coded by these particles.
In particular, ga even codes non-nominative focus elements,
which indicates that the particle is on the way to grammaticalize into a focus particle.
In Par:Dis:Markedness,
I will discuss why the particle ga, among other particles,
is starting to code focus.



So-called subjectsPar:ArgStr

In this section,
I will briefly discuss the relationships between grammatical function and information structure.
This is associated with the issue that has long been discussed in the literature: the connection between topic and subject
li76,duboisetal03.
Since it is impossible to provide an overview of all the things that have been discussed for a long time,
I briefly discuss a few points.

Whereas [2]aoki92 reported that
84.7 of wa attaching nouns code so-called subjects (A and S in my terms, nominative case in her terms) in novels and essays,
only 40.3 of wa in our data codes As and Ss,
as shown in Table Par:ASPTopParT and Figure Par:ASPTopParF.
This table and figure include all kinds of elements excluded in other analyses.
  
 Refer to FW:Cor:AnaRel to see what is excluded.
 
Figure Par:ASPallF,
which represents the overall frequencies of elements,
is shown for comparison.
This graph also includes all kinds of elements excluded in other graphs.
On the other hand, Table Par:ASPTopParT and Figure Par:ASPTopParF show that
59.0 of toiuno-wa codes so-called subjects.
This demonstrates that
toiuno-wa in spoken Japanese is in fact closer to wa in written Japanese
in terms of the preference of coding grammatical functions. 
Although a majority of the literature focuses on wa coding subjects,
the results suggest that wa codes other kinds of elements in spoken Japanese.

So-called subjects have tspecial status in the discourse;
they are interpreted as definite in the discourse
even though the NP is coded by ga instead of wa.
For example,
consider the difference between and .

.
 .[Q:] Why were you absent yesterday?
 .[A:] kuruma-ga inu-o hii-ta-n-desu 

		car-ga dog-o run.over-past-nmlz-plt 

		`(My) car ran over (a) dog.'
 .[A] kuruma-ga inu-ni butukat-ta-n-desu 

   car-ga dog-dat hit-past-nmlz-plt 

   `(My) car hit (a) dog.'


	
. .[Q:] Why were you absent yesterday?
	.[A:] inu-ga kuruma-ni hik-are-ta-n-desu 

		dog-ga car-dat run.over-pass-past-nmlz-plt 

		`(My) dog was run over by (a) car.'
 .[A] inu-ga kuruma-ni butukat-ta-n-desu 

   dog-ga car-dat hit-past-nmlz-plt 

   `(My) dog hit (a) car.'



These utterances represent the same propositional meaning
that can be paraphrased as `(a/the) car ran over (a/the) dog.'
Note that
since Japanese does not have obvious ways to code definiteness,
both `car' and `dog' can be potentially interpreted as either definite or indefinite,
and hence `car' and `dog' are expressed in the same way in and 
except for case markers.
Under these conditions,
the subjects `car' in and `dog' in are interpreted as definite, 
while the non-subjects `car' in and `dog' in are indefinite,
according to the author's intuition.
NPs coded by wa are also likely to be interpreted as definite since
the referent of those NPs are assumed to be evoked.
This observation suggests that subjects without topic-marking still function like topic markers.
This is worth investigating in the future
since my argument is no more than an impressionistic analysis.






















Hierarchy of topic-codingPar:ArgStr:TopHierarchy

There seems to be a hierarchy of topic-coding;
given As and Ss are more likely to be coded by topic markers than given Ps.
For example, consider the following example.
In ,
sohu `grandfather' is introduced in line a, and
pan `bread' is introduced in line b.
In line c, which is of interest in the discussion,
oziityan `grandfather' is coded by wa, but
sore `that', which refers to the bread in line b, is coded by the case particle o.

.
 . uti-no sohu-tteiuno-ga okasi-ga sukina mono-de 

 		out-gen grandfather-toiuno-ga sweet-ga favorite thing-cop 

		`Our grandfather likes sweets.'
 . yoku pan-ya-san-de kasi-pan-o kat-te kuru-n-desu-ga 

   often bread-store-hon-loc sweet-bread-o buy-and come-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

   `(He) often buys sweet bread and comes home,'
 . e n sore-o i maa yoowa oziityan-wa issyookenmee taberu-n-desu-keredomo 

   fl frg that-o frg fl in.a.word grandfather-wa trying.best eat-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

   `that, he tries his best to eat it, but'
 . he cannot eat all and
 . gives leftovers to the dog...
  (S02M0198: 244.48-262.82)

It is unnatural for wa to code sore referring to the bread
instead of oziityan `grandfather',
as shown in [c].
If A (e.g., obaatyan `grandmother') is newly introduced, as in [c],
there is no problem for wa coding sore;
obaatyan `grandmother' is naturally coded by ga instead of wa.

.
 .[c.] e n sore-o/wa i maa yoowa ??oziityan-ga issyookenmee taberu-n-desu-keredomo 

   fl frg that-o/wa frg fl in.a.word grandfather-ga trying.best eat-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

   `that, my grandfather tries his best to eat it, but...'
  .[c.] e n sore-o/wa i maa yoowa obaatyan-ga/??wa issyookenmee taberu-n-desu-keredomo 

   fl frg that-o/wa frg fl in.a.word grandmother-ga/wa trying.best eat-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

   `that, my grandmother tries her best to eat it, but...'
   (modified from [c])

In fact, the majority of anaphoric Ps are still coded by o,
instead of topic markers,
whereas a higher ratio of anaphoric As and Ss are coded by topic markers.
Tables Par:ASPParGivenT and Par:ASPParNewT and
Figures Par:ASPParGivenF and Par:ASPParNewF show
the distribution of topic and case markers coding A, S, and P.
Table Par:ASPParGivenT and Figure Par:ASPParGivenF represent the distribution of topic and case markers coding anaphoric A, S, and P.
As the table and the graph show,
while 44.1 of anaphoric As and 38.8 of anaphoric Ss are coded by topic markers,
only 8.4 of anaphoric Ps are coded by topic markers.
On the other hand,
the majority of non-anaphoric elements are coded by case markers,
although non-anaphoric Ss (most of which are in fact inferable) are remarkably more often coded by wa than others.

I propose the hierarchy for topic-coding.
The given elements higher in this hierarchy are more likely to be coded by topic markers.

.ASPGivenSchema
 A, S  P

The hierarchy indicates that so-called subjects are more likely to be coded by topic markers.
This hierarchy is a topic hierarchy:
the hierarchy of elements which are more likely to be topics givon76,keenan76,comrie79,comrie83,dubois87.

This hierarchy is present in many languages in various ways.
For example, A and S are more likely to agree with the verb than P cross-linguistically.
Also, A and S are more likely to be zero-coded than P.
Japanese wa-coding seems to follow this hierarchy;
if there are two given elements potentially coded by wa,
A and S are preferred over P following the hierarchy in .

Ex or detached NPsPar:Subj:Ex

Finally, I discuss associations between ``Ex'' and topic markers.
In FW:Cor:TopFoc,
Ex was defined as elements ``which appear to be part of the clause but do not have direct relationships with the predicate'' (p. FW:Cor:TopFoc:ExDef).
A typical example is shown in .
In , the predicate nagai `long' is directly related to hana `nose'.
Zoo `elephant' is not directly related to the predicate;
it is not the elephant itself that is long.

. zoo-wa hana-ga nagai 

		elephant-wa nose-ga long 

		`The elephant, the nose is long (The elephant has a long nose).' mikami60

Tables Par:ASPParGivenT and Par:ASPParNewT and
Figures Par:ASPParGivenF and Par:ASPParNewF
show that Ex is only coded by topic markers.
Tables Par:ASPTopParT and Figures Par:ASPTopParF
show that 21.7 of toiuno-wa-coded elements and
5.9 of wa-coded elements are categorized into Ex.

lambrecht94
discusses cross-linguistic cases of Ex (in his term, ``detached'' topic)
and argues that
``in some languages at least, the detached topic NP cannot be a constituent [...] of the clause with which it is pragmatically associated'' (p. 192).
In , examples in English,
the detached topics are not constituents of the clause;
rather, they have a part-whole relation with some element(s) within a clause.
In [a], the detached topic the typical family today is not a constituent of the clause;
instead, it is associated with the husband and the wife pragmatically.
In the same way, the detached topics tulips in [b] and
other languages in [c]
are pragmatically associated with constituents of the clauses bulbs and tones, respectively.

.


 . (From a TV interview about the availability of child care) 

   That isn't the typical family anymore.
   The typical family today,
   the husband and the wife both work.
 . (Talking about how to grow flowers) 

   Tulips, you have to plant new bulbs every year?
 . (Lecture in an introductory linguistics course) 

   Other languages, you don't just have straight tones like that.



  .[] [193]lambrecht94

These detached topics are strikingly similar to
``Ex'' in Japanese.

Lambrecht also discusses cases in which
topics are not counted as constituents of the clause
even though they appear to be constituents.
German, for example, has the principle that only allows the verb in the second position within a clause, as exemplified in [a-d].
However, the detached topic constituents that appear at the beginning are not counted as the first constituent of the clause.

As exemplified in [e],
the verb isst `ate' appears in the second position assuming that the preceding den `it' is in the first position,
which indicates that
the detached topic den Apfel is not counted as the first constituent in the clause.
In fact, as in [f],
it is unacceptable
if the detached topic den Apfel is counted as the first constituent.
  
 Apfel `apple' in e, f of Par:Subj:Ex:Ex:Apfel is considered to be ``detached'' because
 the resumptive pronoun den `it.acc' is regarded as argument of the clause and Apfel itself does not function as argument.
 

.Par:Subj:Ex:Ex:Apfel
 . Hans isst den Apfel. 

   Hans eat the.acc apple 

   `Hans eats the apple.' (SVO)
 . Den Apfel isst Hans. (OVS)
 . *Den Apfel Hans isst.(*OSV)
 . Den isst Hans. 

   it.acc eat Hans 

   `Hans eats it.' (OVS)
 . Den Apfel den isst Hans. 

   the.acc apple it.acc eat Hans 

   `The apple, Hans eats it.'  (TOVS)
 . *Den Apfel isst Hans den. (*TVSO)
 .[] (op.cit.: 194)

Both the topicalized NP den Apfel and the resumptive pronoun den in [e] appear as accusative.
According to Lambrecht, however,
it is optional for the topicalized NP,
while it is obligatory for the resumptive pronoun.
This is also reminiscent of topic-marking in Japanese.
In Japanese,
nominative and accusative codings are overridden by topic-marking
and the case for A, S, and P coded by topic markers are not overtly expressed
as has been discussed in Back:GeneralChar:Wa.





The fact that topics tend to be ``detached'' from the predicate and
lose case marking cross-linguistically suggests the possibility that
there are some universal motivations behind this phenomenon.
I argue that at least one of the motivations is clause-chaining.
In clause-chaining,
the speaker combines multiple clauses to form a thematic unit
longacre85,martin92,givon01.
is an example of clause-chaining.

. She came in, [] stopped, [] looked around and froze.

     [349]givon01

By combining clauses in this way,
thematic continuity is achieved.
In clause-chaining,
the detached topic, which typically appears utterance-initially, as will be discussed in Chapter WordOrder,
is not necessarily an argument of the clauses;
instead, it is pragmatically related to the following clauses.
For example, in ,
where the speaker talks about a life in Iran,
mukoo-no hito `people there (in Iran)' in [a] is detached
and annotated as ``Ex''
because its predicate hukaku `deep', which has a part-whole relations with the people, has the so-called subject hori `(face) form'.
In [b-c], the speaker continues to talk about her
by clause-chaining.
Kodomo `child' in [c] also has a part-whole relation
with the Iran people.

.
 . eto n mukoo-no hito-toiuno-wa hontooni hori-ga hukaku-te 

      fl fl there-gen person-toiuno-wa really form-ga deep-and 

      `People there (in Iran), (their) face forms are really chiseled,'
 . kiree-de 

      beautiful-and 

      `beautiful,'
 . kodomo-nanka-wa anoo sugoku kawaii kao-o si-tei-mashi-ta 

      child-hdg-wa fl very cute face-o do-prog-plt-past 

      `children had very cute faces.'
      S03F0072: 375.01-386.35


Clause-chaining is a useful way to talk about something;
the speaker puts the topic at the beginning and
continues to describe the topic as much as s/he can.
In the descriptions in clause-chaining,
the topic is not necessarily an argument;
it is pragmatically associated with each clause.
The hearer does not get lost.
The hearer can trace the topic
when the speaker provides enough evidence
through linguistic expressions (such as particles, word order, and intonation) and other means (such as gesture, background knowledge, sequence of conversation, etc.).

[Chapter 2]mikami60 points out that
wa-coded NPs can ``go beyond periods'' (p. 117) and ``commas'' (p. 130).
This is closely related to what I argue here.







He states:
``in general, `X-wa', skipping adverbial clauses in the middle, governs the final main clause.
However, it [sometimes] governs the verbs in the middle a little bit;
this is what I call [wa's] going beyond commas'' (p. 130).
Of course, there are no commas and periods in spoken language,
wa and toiuno-wa go beyond ``commas'' and ``periods'' by governing the whole clause-chaining.

Distribution of markers and semantic space

	Anaphoric distance vs. expression type (all)
	DistExpTypeF2
	center








figure

As discussed in ParIntro,
the particles code elements with features that can be mapped onto a conceptual space.
As reflected in Table ParInfoStatusT and discussion in TopPar,
topic markers map onto a conceptual space of the given-new taxonomy,
while, as in Table OvertZeroCaseParT1 and discussion in CasePar,
case markers map onto a conceptual space of agentivity, focushood, contrastiveness, and possibly animacy.

The semantic map of topic markers in Japanese indicates that
inferable and evoked statuses form a connected region and are expressed by the same marker wa,
while declining and unused statuses form a connected region and are expressed by the same marker (a copula followed by kedo or ga);
hence, the inferable status is closer to the evoked status, and the declining status is closer to unused in the conceptual space.
This makes sense because inferable elements are more relevant to
the current topic than declining elements.
For example, in ,
the inferable element gen'in `cause' is coded by wa.
The element `cause' is inferable because the disease has been already introduced and the cause of the disease can be considered to be part of the knowledge of getting a disease.

.
 . (The speaker got a rare disease.)
 . First I visited several local hospitals.
 . I was examined several times, but
 . gen'in-wa humee-de 

   cause-wa unclear-cop 

   `the cause (of the disease) was unclear.'
   (S02F0010: 74.93-82.60)






In ,
the cause of the disease is relevant to the current topic, i.e., the speaker's disease.
Later in this speech,
the speaker talks about her parents and friends;
in this case the cause of the disease is considered to be declining and is less relevant to the current topic (her parents and friends).
Declining elements like the cause of the disease become unused as the time passes.
If the speaker brings up the cause of the disease two days later,
she will code it as unused.
Thus, I argue that the adjacency of inferable and evoked statuses and that of declining and unused statuses are cognitively motivated and I argue that this is universal.

Moreover,
I propose that there are at least two kinds of evoked status:
evoked and what I call strongly evoked.
Evoked elements are full NPs, and
strongly evoked elements are zero and overt pronouns.




Figure DistExpTypeF2 shows the time difference (anaphoric distance) on a logarithmic scale between when the first mora of the element in question is produced and when that of its antecedent is produced.
Zero pronouns are assumed to be produced at the time when
the first mora of the predicate is produced.
The anaphoric distance approximates activation cost;
smaller distance indicates lower activation cost,
while larger distance indicates higher activation cost.
Figure DistExpTypeF2 represents the anaphoric distance of three kinds of elements:
full NPs, pronouns, and zero pronouns.

As is clear from the figure,
the anaphoric distance of zero and overt pronouns is smaller than
that of NPs,
which indicates that
zero and overt pronouns are more evoked than full NPs (fixed effects model, ).
Therefore, I propose the status called ``strongly evoked''.
I add this status in Table ParInfoStatusT2.
Since overt pronouns coded by the topic markers are as strongly evoked as zero pronouns,
I suppose that the topic markers wa and toiuno-wa can also code strongly evoked elements.


Markers for focus coding map onto agentivity, focushood, contrastiveness, and possibly animacy
as has been discussed in CasePar.
Table OvertZeroCaseParT in CasePar indicates that
A and agent S are adjacent to each other, and
patient S and P are adjacent.
This makes sense because
A is conceptually closer to agent S, and
P is conceptually closer to patient P.

Distribution of markers and markednessPar:Dis:Markedness

As discussed in CasePar and summarized in Table OvertZeroCaseParT,
the distinction between overt vs. zero particles for focus coding is sensitive to grammatical functions, contrastiveness, and animacy.

The distribution of overt vs. zero particles for non-contrastive focus coding in Table OvertZeroCaseParT
is similar to that of split intransitive languages,
if one ignores ga-coding for patient S.
In general, split intransitive languages code S differently
depending on whether it is an agent or a patient;
agent S is coded in the same way as A in the transitive clause,
while patient S is coded in the same way as P.
shows examples from Georgian.
	 
	Examples are from the handouts in the lecture called Typology and Universals given by Matthew Dryer at the University at Buffalo in 2010.
	Glosses are modified.
	
. Georgian, South Caucasian
	. vano-m gamozarda Zma-O 

		Vano-a 3.3.grow brother-p 

		`Vano raised his brother.' (A  P)
	. vano-m imGera 

		Vano-a 3.sing 

		`Vano sang.' (Agent S)



	. rezo-O gamoizarda 

		Rezo-p 3.grow 

		`Rezo grew up.' (Patient S)












Spoken Japanese and Georgian in follow the typological tendency that
agent S and A tend to be overtly coded,
while patient S and P tend to be zero-coded.

On the other hand,
Spoken Japanese does not follow the tendency of nominative/accusative languages:
the tendency that A and S (nominative elements) are more likely to be zero-coded than P (accusative elements).
I argue that, in coding focus elements,
patient elements are ``unmarked'',
i.e., more frequent than agent elements,
and are more likely to be zero-coded than agent elements.
This is supported by studies such as dubois87 and duboisetal03.
On the other hand,
in coding topic elements,
agent elements are more frequent than patient elements,
and are more likely to be zero-coded than patient elements.
This is observed in another dialect of Japanese: Kansai Japanese.
In Kansai Japanese,
contrastive topic agents (A and agent S) can be zero-coded,
while contrastive topic patients (P and patient S) are overtly coded,
which is summarized in Table DistPartTopKJ.
See nakagawa13m
for more detailed discussion on the relation
between markedness and the distribution of zero vs. overt particles in Standard and Kansai Japanese.

As has been discussed in Par:CasePar:Ga:GaFoc,
ga sometimes codes non-nominative focus NPs.
The theory of markedness also gives a hint to explain why ga is on the way to grammaticalize into a focus particle;
focus A is the most rare in natural occurring discourse
and it is likely for Japanese native speakers to associate the marker ga with focushood.
On the other hand, P is very frequently focused,
in which case, it is less likely to associate the marker o with focushood.








Summary


Summary of this chapter

This chapter discussed the distributions of so-called topic marker and case markers in Japanese.
I argued that
different markers are sensitive to different features, and
at the same time,
 multiple features contribute to the usage of a single marker.



Remaining issues

While there are many remaining issues,
one of the biggest issues is that
it is necessary to test the proposals in this chapter through other empirical methods.
If the proposals are supported also by other methods,
they become more sound.
In particular, the distribution of the zero particles is mainly based on a few native speakers' acceptability judgements.
This should be tested with a larger number of native speakers.
One possible experiment is to ask subjects to listen to short conversation where the particles in question are blurred
and to produce what they hear.
This is easier than subtle acceptability judgements and linguistically naive subjects can also participate in it.

Another issue is the focus test.
So far we only have the hee test and the no test,
which depend on the author's acceptability judgements.
One possible experiment is to ask subjects to listen to speech used in this study
and respond to what the speaker means by hee
as if they were the hearers.
The elements that many subjects respond to are more likely to be foci.
Another possibility is to investigate conversations and study the elements that the hearer actually responds to.
denetal12 annotated response tokens like hee and the elements those response tokens address.
One might be able to use this annotation to test the second hypothesis.

in terms of their positions in a clause.



Elements are counted by phrases (so called bunsetsu).
The y-axis indicates the frequency of elements and
the x-axis indicates the position of elements:
1 means that the element in question appeared in the first position in the clause,
2 means that it appeared in the second position,
and so on.
I used the values of nth originally included in CSJ.
The reason why the frequencies of 1 and 2 are lower than 3 is that
the linguistic categories that appear in the first or second position
are typically fillers, connectives, and adjectives and
they are excluded from the analysis.
The fact that the elements later than fifth in the clause appear very frequently
might be counterintuitive based on the ordinary idea of a clause;
a clause consists of a single predicate and at most three arguments and a few more adjuncts.
In spoken language, however,
there are many fillers, intensifiers like hontooni `really', and paraphrases,
which make the clause longer.
Since nth simply counts the position of a phrase in terms of linear position, and not structurally,
embedded clauses such as relative clauses are also included in the count.
I assume that it is worth including these intervening expressions
to analyze where a phrase can be interrupted by them and where it cannot.
In fact, the following results show that most non-anaphoric elements appear immediately before the predicate, not interrupted by fillers, intensifiers, and so on (see WOPrePredEles).
Moreover,
CSJ has a unique definition of clause, which is not always the same as the intuitive of clause;
rather, a clause in CSJ is closer to a single series of clause-chaining.
For example,
some subordinate markers such as -to `if' and -te `and' do not work as clause boundaries.
These characteristics cause more elements to appear in later positions.
See maruyamaetal06 for a detailed definition of clause unit.

Figure DEPositionISF and DEPositionPerF show
element positions and their frequencies based on information status and persistence, respectively.
The information status ``anaphoric'' in this study just means ``the element in question has a co-referential antecedent'' and ``non-anaphoric'' means ``it does not.''
``Persistent'' means ``the referent in question is also mentioned in the following discourse'', and ``non-persistent'' means ``it is not.''

See FW:Cor:AnaRel for the detail of the annotation procedure.
As was discussed in TopPar,
a linear mixed effects model was employed to predict information status (anaphoric vs. non-anaphoric).
As fixed effects, word order (nth in CSJ, see WO:Intro for the definition of this annotation), particles (toiuno-wa, wa, mo, ga, o, ni), and intonation (phrasal vs. clausal IU, see Int:PIUCIU for the definitions) were included, and
as a random effect, the speaker (TalkID) was included.
The model with the effects of word order, particles, and intonation is significantly different from the models without each of them, which indicates that
word order, particles, and intonation respectively contribute to the prediction of information status.
The model with all three effects is significantly different from the model without the effect of word order (likelihood ratio test, );
it is significantly different from the model without the effect of particles () and the model without the effect of intonation ()

As was also discussed in TopPar,
a linear mixed effects model was also applied to predict persistence (persistent vs. non-persistent).
Word order, particles, and intonation were included as fixed effects, and
the speaker (TalkID) was included as a random effect.
The model with the effects of word order and particles is again significantly different from the models without either of them (likelihood ratio test,  for the model without word order,  for the model without particles).
However, the model with the effect of intonation is not significantly different from the model without it ()
The results are to be discussed more in WOSentInitEles.

Figure DiffAllF shows the overall distribution of elements in terms of their distance from the predicate;

1 indicates that the element appears right before the predicate,
2 indicates that there is one element between the preceding element and the following predicate, and so on.
If the element appears right after the predicate,
the distance is counted as -1.
Since the numbers of post-predicate elements are too small to achieve any generalization,
they are excluded from the figures.
Post-predicate elements will be discussed in comparison with dialogues
in WOPostPreEles.

Figures DiffInfoStatusF and DiffPerF show the distance between the element and the predicate
depending on information status and persistence.
A linear mixed effects model of information status (the distance from the predicate and particles as fixed effects and the speaker as a random effect) indicates that
whereas the model with particles is significantly different from the model without them (likelihood ratio test, ),
the difference between the models with and without the distance from the predicate is only marginally significant ().
This entails that the effect of particles significantly contributes to the model,
but the effect of the distance is inconclusive (see WOPrePredEles for discussion).
On the other hand, a linear mixed effects model of persistence (fixed and random effects are the same as above) shows that the effects of both particles and the distance are significant to the model ( for both the model without particle and that without the distance).
The results are also to be discussed in further detail in WOPrePredEles.

Clause-initial elementsWOSentInitEles

This section discusses clause-initial elements.
It will be argued that shared elements (i.e., unused, declining, inferable, or evoked elements) tend to appear clause-initially
in GivenAppearClause-Initially,
and that
persistent elements tend to appear clause-initially
in PersistentAppearClause-Initially.
From these observations,
it will be generalized that topics tend to appear clause-initially,
as predicted from the previous literature.
Finally in TopicAppearClause-Initially,
I discuss the motivations for topics to appear clause-initially.



Shared elements tend to appear clause-initiallyGivenAppearClause-Initially


































Figure DEPositionISF shows the frequency of elements and their positions
based on the information status.
Anaphoric elements appear most frequently in the third position.
On the other hand, the non-anaphoric elements appear most frequently in the fourth position,
but those in the fifth and sixth positions also appear frequently.


















These distributions of elements in different information statuses appear to replicate the classic observation that
topics tend to appear earlier in a clause,
i.e., the from-old-to-new principle mathesius28,firbas64,danes70,kuno78,gundel88
This is explicitly stated in .

. oldnewprincipleFrom-old-to-new principle:
 In languages in which word order is relatively free,
 the unmarked word order of constituents is old,
 predictable information first and new, unpredictable information last.
 ([][54]kuno78, [][p. 326]kuno04)


This principle is motivated by the accumulative nature of processing utterances;
old (or given) elements work as anchors that relate
the previous utterance and the following utterance.








This principle appears to be supported by examples such as the following.


















In ,
sore `it' in line c, referring back to kasi-pan `sweetbread' in line b, precedes the A element oziityan `grandfather'.

. PronIni1



 . uti-no sohu-tteiuno-ga okasi-ga sukina mono-de 

 		out-gen grandfather-toiuno-ga sweet-ga favorite thing-cop 

		`Our grandfather likes sweets.'
 . yoku pan-ya-san-de kasi-pan-o kat-te kuru-n-desu-ga 

   often bread-store-hon-loc sweet-bread-o buy-and come-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

   `(He) often buys sweet bread and comes home,'
 . e n sore-o i maa yoowa oziityan-wa issyookenmee taberu-n-desu-keredomo 

   fl frg it-o frg fl in.a.word grandfather-wa trying.best eat-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

   `that, he tries his best to eat it, but'
 . he cannot eat all and
 . gives leftovers to the dog...
  (S02M0198: 244.48-262.82)





Note that sore `it' in line c is not coded by wa but by o.
This shows that clause-initial shared elements are not necessarily coded by topic markers,
although it is predicted that elements coded by topic markers would be more likely to appear clause-initially than those coded by case markers (see the discussion in WO:ClauseInit:Ident:Topic).

Similarly in ,
sore `it' in line c refers back to buraunkan `cathode ray tube'
and appears at the beginning of the clause,
preceding other elements.

.PronIni2
 . oo-gata-no-ne 

   large-type-gen-fp 

   `(It's) a larger type (of cathode ray tube).'
 . yoku maa a hooru-toka-ni aru-yoona oo-gata-no ee buraunkan-nan-da-kedomo 

   often fl fl hall-etc.-dat exist-like large-tyle-gen fl cathode.ray.tube-nmlz-cop-though 

   `(It's) a large type of cathode ray tube typically equipped in a large hall, and'
 . sore-o-ne koo kotti-kara kotti-ni moti-ageru-toiu-yoona 

  that-o-fp this.way here-from here-from bring-rise-quot-like 

  `this (cathode ray tube), (people) brought it from here to there.'
  . some people were doing something like that.
   (S05M1236: 471.26-490.38)




However,
this is not the whole story;
there are many counter-examples where non-anaphoric precedes anaphoric.

Table GNT shows the number of cases
where anaphoric precedes non-anaphoric and non-anaphoric precedes anaphoric within the same clause.
There are 102 cases where anaphoric precedes non-anaphoric,
while there are 63 cases where non-anaphoric precedes anaphoric.
The cases where anaphoric precedes non-anaphoric only slightly outnumber the cases where non-anaphoric precedes anaphoric.
63 cases (39.4) is too large a number to believe that
they are mere exceptions to the principle oldnewprinciple.

I do not claim that the principle oldnewprinciple is not correct,
but I do claim that the principle does not apply to all cases.
Anaphoric elements precede non-anaphoric elements
if the anaphoric elements are assumed to refer to the ``same'' entity which has been already mentioned.
In other words,
shared elements precede non-anaphoric elements.




For example, in ,
mizu `water' is repeatedly mentioned in the utterance,
but it is never produced clause-initially.
I argue that this is because
mizu `water' in [b] and later is not assumed to refer to the ``same'' entity already mentioned in the previous discourse.

.WO:ClauseInit:Given:mizu
 . desukara daitai iti-niti-ni ni-rittoru-no mizu-o tot-te kudasai-to iw-are-te

	`we were forced to drink (water).'
 . they think that drinking water is very important.
  (S01F0151: 339.78-366.29)





In the same way,
tenkan `epilepsy' appears many times in ,
but never appears clause-initially.

.WO:ClauseInit:Given:tenkan
 . ato ik-kai tenkan okosi-tara sinu-tte it-te-ta-n-desu-kedo

      `meanwhile, (the dog) has an epilepsy seizure, and...'
 . The dog recovered this time, but has an epilepsy seizure several times and finally died. (130.8 sec omitted.)

 . the dog could not get out of there and died, we [the family members] were talking like that.
 S02M0198: 558.7-712.8












Whether the speaker refers to the shared entity mentioned previously
depends on the speaker's subjective judgement rather than on objective reasoning.
In , for example,
the anaphoric element kuruma `car' in line c does not appear clause-initially for the same reason as in and .
However, kuruma `car' in line b and d are clearly the same entity.

.WO:ClauseInit:Given:kuruma
 . kirauea-kazan-mo mappu-o kai-masi-te 

 		Kilauea-volcano-also map-o buy-plt-and 

		`Also for Kilauea, (we) bought a map and'
 . de zibun-tati-de ma rentakaa kuruma-o tobasi-te e iki-masi-ta 

 		then self-pl-by fl rent-a-car car-o drive-and fl go-plt-past 

		`(we) drove there by rent-a-car by ourselves.'
 .[] (83.52 sec talking about the mountain.)
 . de anoo jibun-no koko koko-de tyotto tome-te miyoo-to omot-ta toko-ni koo kuruma-o tome-te 

 		and fl self-gen frg here-loc a.bit stop-and try-quot think-past place-dat this.way car-o stop-and 

	 	`At the place (we) wanted to stop, (we) stopped the car,'
 . you can take pictures and so on.
 (S00F0014: 843.23-940.34)





I argue that, in this case, the speaker does not care about the identity of the car.
Rather, she focuses on talking about her trip to Kirauea;
the car she was in is not important for this speech.
As will be discussed in PersistentAppearClause-Initially,
importance, as well as the identity, of the entity contributes to word order in spoken Japanese.
Important (i.e., persistent) elements appear clause-initially.

Interestingly,
these elements which are repeatedly mentioned but never appear clause-initially are not referred to by zero or overt pronouns.
It is especially difficult to zero-pronominalize tenkan `epilepsy' in [b-f] and kuruma `car' in [d].
  
 It is difficult to apply this test in WO:ClauseInit:Given:mizu because mizu `water' accompanies numeral modifiers such as 
 `of two liters' and `two cups of'.
 
Zero pronouns are considered to be the most accessible topics [17]givon83.
To zero-pronominalize,
the speaker needs to provide signals to let the hearer know which is the topic, as will be discussed in TopicAppearClause-Initially.



































































From the discussion above,
there are at least two predictions testable in the corpus.
Firstly, since evoked and inferable elements are coded by topic markers, as was shown in Chapter Particles,
it is predicted that
elements coded by topic markers tend to appear earlier in a clause (WO:ClauseInit:Ident:Topic).
This is because elements assumed by the speaker to be evoked or inferable
are also assumed to be shared.
Secondly,
since pronouns essentially code shared elements which have been mentioned,
pronouns are also predicted to appear earlier in a clause (WO:ClauseInit:Ident:Pron).
Both predictions are confirmed in the following investigations.
Thirdly, I will show that clause-initial elements are not sensitive to activation cost;
unused elements can also appear clause-initially (WO:ClauseInit:Ident:ActStatus).
Evoked, inferable, declining, and unused elements are shared
(See Table ActStatusCorpus).
Therefore, the claim that shared elements appear clause-initially is supported.

Let us test the prediction that elements coded by topic markers tend to appear earlier in a clause.
Figure WOTopParF shows the distribution of topic-coded elements
and their positions.
Compare this figure with Figure WOCaseParF,
which shows the distribution of case-coded elements and their positions.
It is clear that
elements coded by topic markers are more skewed to earlier positions within a clause as compared to those coded by case markers.

is an example of a wa-coded element appearing clause-initially.
The wa-coded element hone `bone' in line a,
which has been discussed in the previous discourse,
is separated from the predicate by an intervening locative (a tomb for animals in the temple).
The intervening part is long and the predicate finally appears in line d.

.
	. ee suriipii-no itibu-no oo hone-wa 

		fl Sleepy-gen part-gen fl bone-wa 

		`Part of bone of Sleepy (dog's name),'
	. sono morimati-no watasi-no senzo-no o hait-teru otera-no 

		that Morimachi-gen 1sg-gen ancestor-gen fl enter-prog temple-gen 

		`the temple in Morimachi where my ancestors were,'
	. yahari ano doobutu-no kuyootoo-ga ari-masu 

		again that animal-gen tomb-ga exist-plt 

		`there are tombs for animals,'
	. sotira-no hoo-ni osame-masite-ne 

		that-gen direction-dat place-plt-and 

		`(we) placed (his bone) there.'
	(S02M1698: 620.12-634.26)


In ,
sono ko `that puppy',
whose referent has appeared in the previous line a,
is also an example of a wa-coded element appearing clause-initially.
The element is also separated from the predicate
by an intervening argument `distemper'.

.
	. mosi koinu-o kat-tesimat-tara 

		if puppy-o keep-pfv-cond 

		`If you decided to keep a new puppy,'
	. sono ko-wa mata zisutenpaa-ni kakat-te sin-zyau-kara 

			that puppy-wa again distemper-dat catch-and die-pfv-because 

			`the puppy will die of distemper again, so'
	. keep a new puppy after this winter, this is what we were told by the vet.
	(S02M0198: 108.68-126.70)





























































Wa appearing in the initial position is already conventionalized, and
it is possible to test this with acceptability judgements.
It is not acceptable for wa-coded P to appear between the focus agent and the predicate except for contrastive readings of wa.




As the contrast between [a-c] shows,
the zero-coded P hon `book' in [a] right before the predicate is acceptable,
while the wa-coded hon `book' in the same position in [b] is not acceptable.
To express the idea of [b],
the wa-coded P should precede A taroo `Taro'.

. . taroo-ga hon yon-deru-yo 

		Taro-ga book read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading a book.'
	. ??taroo-ga hon-wa yon-deru-yo 

		Taro-ga book-wa read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'
	. hon-wa taroo-ga yon-deru-yo 

		book-wa Taro-ga read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'
		(Constructed)

There is only one example (out of 9 wa-coded Ps) in the corpus
where wa-coded P is preceded by ga-coded A.
This wa-coded P is contrastive, which will be discussed in WODiscussion.

I propose the hypothesis that elements which belong to the same unit of information structure appear adjacent within a clause.
I call this the information-structure continuity principle in word order.

. IScontinuityPInformation-structure continuity principle:
 A unit of information structure is continuous in a clause;
 i.e., elements which belong to the same unit are adjacent with each other.

This principle explains why [b] is not acceptable,
while [a,c] are acceptable.
The information structure of each of the examples is represented in .
In [b],
the topic P element hon-wa `book-wa' intervenes between two focus elements taroo-ga `Taro-ga' and yon-deru `read-prog', which is not acceptable.
In [c], on the other hand,
the topic P does not split up the domain of focus,
and the whole sentence is acceptable.
In [a],
all the elements including hon `book' belong to focus
and hence hon in this position is acceptable.

. . [taroo-ga hon yon-deru]-yo 

		Taro-ga book read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading a book.'
	. ??[taroo-ga] [hon-wa] [yon-deru]-yo 

		Taro-ga book-wa read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'
	. [hon-wa] [taroo-ga yon-deru]-yo 

		book-wa Taro-ga read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'

Interestingly,
it is possible for wa-coded A to be preceded by o-coded P, as shown in [a] (compare this with [b]).

.
. hon-o taroo-wa  yon-deru-yo 

		book-o Taro-wa read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'
. hon-o taroo-ga yon-deru-yo 

		book-o Taro-ga read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'

As was argued above,
the preposed P, hon-o `book-o' in ,
is topical, which is represented as in .

.
. [hon-o taroo-wa]  [yon-deru]-yo 

		book-o Taro-wa read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'
. [hon-o] [taroo-ga yon-deru]-yo 

		book-o Taro-ga read-prog-fp 

		`Taro is reading the book.'

As shown in [a],
the two topic elements hon-o `book-o' and taroo-wa `Taro-wa' are adjacent to each other and hence this sentence is acceptable.
Also in [b],
the only topic element hon-o `book-o' does not split up the focus elements taroo-ga yon-deru, which is predicted to be acceptable.
Hon-o `book-o' could be focus instead of topic in [b], since given elements can be focus.
But it is reasonable to think of a situation where given focus elements are preposed
for the sentence to be a smooth transition from the previous sentence.
The information-structure continuity principle IScontinuityP still holds in either case.

Note that IScontinuityP does not refer to word order;
rather, it is about adjacency.
I argue that this principle is also at work in intonation (see Chapter Intonation).

What is the difference between clause-initial elements coded by topic markers and those coded by case markers?
As was discussed in Par:ArgStr:TopHierarchy,
there is a hierarchy of topic coding ASPGivenSchema,
which is repeated here as .

.
 A, S  P

The hierarchy indicates that
evoked or inferable A and S are more likely to be coded by topic markers than P in the same status.
Word order is not affected by this hierarchy.
Figures WOSGivenF and WOPGivenF show word order of
anaphoric S and P, respectively.
Compare these with Figures WOSNewF and WOPNewF,
which show word order of non-anaphoric S and P.
Word order of A is omitted because the number is too small.
As can be seen from the contrasts between Figures WOSGivenF and WOSNewF and between Figures WOPGivenF and WOPNewF,
anaphoric elements are more likely to appear earlier in a clause than non-anaphoric elements.
Although the contrast is less clear between anaphoric vs. non-anaphoric P,
especially notable is that there are three times as many anaphoric Ps as non-anaphoric Ps in the third position.
(There are 27 anaphoric Ps in the third position,
while there are only 10 non-anaphoric P.)
I speculate that the contrast is less clear in anaphoric vs. non-anaphoric P than S because there are cases like WO:ClauseInit:Given:mizu and WO:ClauseInit:Given:tenkan,
where the element is annotated as anaphoric but is considered to be not shared.
In this case, P appears pre-predicatively rather than clause-initially.
Therefore, I argue that,
while elements coded by topic markers are likely to appear earlier in a clause,
word order is independent of topic marking.
Topic markers are sensitive to the given-new taxonomy, as was discussed in Chapter Particles;
clause-initial position is sensitive to sharedness.
Topic markers and word order are sensitive to different aspects of topichood.

Pronouns appear clause-initiallyWO:ClauseInit:Ident:Pron

Next let us examine the position of pronouns.
Figure WOExpTypeF shows the positions of pronouns.
Figure DEPositionAllF, repeated as Figure DEPositionAllF2 for comparison,
represents the distributions of all elements.
Although the number of pronouns is small,
it is clear, comparing with the overall distributions of elements in Figure DEPositionAllF2, that
the order of pronouns is skewed to earlier positions within a clause.
Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that
pronouns are likely to appear earlier in a clause.
Examples of pronouns appearing earlier in a clause are shown in PronIni1 and PronIni2 above.
The result is compatible with yamashita02 and kondoyamashita07.

Unused elements appear clause-initiallyWO:ClauseInit:Ident:ActStatus

Not only evoked, inferable, and declining elements,
but also unused elements appear clause-initially.
Elements coded by the copula followed by ga or kedo are unused elements, as was discussed in Chapter Particles.
  
 See BackSubSubKedo for the reason why
 an element coded by the copula followed by ga or kedo is not considered to be a clause.
 
It is very unnatural when they are preceded by other arguments.
For example,
as shown in the contrast between [a] and [b],
rei-no ken `that issue' cannot be felicitously preceded by another argument, in this case kotira-de `this side'.

.
 . rei-no ken-desu-ga kotira-de nantoka nari-sou-desu 

      that-gen issue-cop.plt-though this.side-loc whatever become-will-cop.plt

      this.side-loc that-gen issue-cop.plt-though whatever become-will-cop.plt 


In a similar manner,
yamada-no koto `the issue of Yamada' cannot naturally be preceded by an adverbial, ano mama `that way',
as shown in the contrast between [a] and [b].

.
 . yamada-no koto-da-kedo ano mama hot-toi-te ii-no-kana

Unused elements include indefinite elements
although it is counter-intuitive to consider indefinite NPs as being ``shared''.
For example, as was mentioned in Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite,
an indefinite element can appear clause-initially
if the speaker assumes the hearer to remember that the speaker (or somebody else) has talked about a category the element refers to.
For example, as shown in [Y],
repeated from Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite:Ex:Mango1 in Fr:Definition:TFFeathers:Definite,
having mentioned a category of mango makes it possible for mangoo `mango' to appear clause-initially,
even though
mangoo `mango' is clearly indefinite
since the hearer has no way to tell which mango the speaker ate.
I regard this as unused and hence shared.

. Context:
	Y told H that he had never seen and eaten mangoes.
	H told Y that they are delicious.
	Several days later, Y finally ate a mango.
	.[Y:] mangoo konoaida miyako-zima-de tabe-ta-yo 

			mango the.other.day Miyako-island-loc eat-past-fp 

			`(I) ate (a) mango (we talked about) in Miyako island the other day.'
	.[Y:] konoaida miyako-zima-de mangoo tabe-ta-yo 

			the.other.day Miyako-island-loc mango eat-past-fp 

			`(I) ate (a) mango in Miyako island the other day.'

In this case, however,
mangoo `mango' in the pre-predicate position is also felicitous,
as in [Y],
which indicates that this is a borderline case;
mangoo can be a topic in the sense that
it is unused and the speaker has talked about it before,
while it can be a focus in the sense that
it is new to the discourse and indefinite.

On the other hand, in [Y],

where the speaker does not assume the hearer to remember that
the speaker has talked about mango,
clause-initial mangoo `mango' is infelicitous,
whereas pre-predicate mangoo is perfectly acceptable.

. Context:
	Y and H have not met for a few months.
	.[H:] What did you do these days?
	.[Y:] ??mangoo konoaida miyako-zima-de tabe-ta-yo 

			mango the.other.day Miyako-island-loc eat-past-fp 

		(=[Y])
	.[Y:] konoaida miyako-zima-de mangoo tabe-ta-yo 

			the.other.day Miyako-island-loc mango eat-past-fp 

			`(I) ate (a) mango in Miyako island the other day.'
		(=[Y])

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that
shared elements include those which refer to categories the speaker (or somebody else) has talked about and that
they can appear clause-initially.



Persistent elements tend to appear clause-initiallyPersistentAppearClause-Initially

Persistent elements are skewed to earlier positions more than non-persistent elements,
as shown in Figure DEPositionPerF.





















The following are examples of persistent elements appearing clause-initially.
In ,
hihu-byoo `skin-disease' in line a, coded by the topic marker toiuno-wa,
appear clause-initially.
The predicate appears in line c,
separated from the subject by a proposition in line b and also another argument (hito-ni `person-by') of the clause.
Also in line d, kore-wa `this-wa', referring to `skin-disease', appears clause initially.

.
 . hihu-byoo-toiuno-wa 

 		skin-disease-toiuno-wa 

		`The skin disease,'
 . damat-tei-temo 

 		keep.silent-prog-even.if 

		`even if you don't tell people about it,'
 . hito-ni mir-are-te-simau mono-dat-ta-node 

 		person-by see-pass-and-pfv thing-cop-past-because 

		`people can see it, so'
 . kore-wa ano omot-ta izyooni seesintekini kutuu-desi-ta 

 		this-wa fl think-past more mentally painful-cop-past 

		`this was mentally painful more than I had expected.'
		(S02F0100: 222.75-231.09)


Similarly, in ,
sore-wa `that-wa' in line b and g,
and sore-dake-wa `that-only-wa' in line i,
all of which refer to `chelow kebab' in line a,
appears clause-initially.

.
 . There is a dish called chelow kebab.
 . de sore-wa eeto gohan-ni eeto bataa-o maze-te 

 	and that-wa fl rice-to fl butter-o mix-and 

	`That, you mix rice with butter...'

 . you mix it and eat it.

 . sore-wa kekkoo sonnani hituzi-no oniku-no kusasa-mo naku-te

		`This is the only dish I could eat among Iranian dishes.'
 (S03F0072: 446.03-447.66)




As was mentioned in WO:Intro,
both word order and particles significantly contribute to predict persistence,
contrary to the result of imamura17,
who concludes that ``scrambling [PSV order] is pertinent to anaphorically prominent but cataphorically non-prominent objects and that topicalization is especially germane to `continuing topic' as the referent of the object'' (p. 78).
There are a few potential reasons for why the results of the present work are different from those of imamura17.
One potential reason is the difference of modalities:
imamura17 employed a corpus of written Japanese (the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese, BCCWJ), while the present study employs spoken Japanese.
Related to the first point,
clause-chaining, which I will point out is one of the motivations for why clause-initial elements tend to be persistent (see the next section),
only appears in spoken Japanese, but not in written Japanese.
In any case, this is a mere speculation and further studies are needed to analyze
why the results of these two studies differ.



Motivations for topics appearing clause-initiallyTopicAppearClause-Initially

As was pointed out by many linguists,
topics tend to appear clause-initially
because they function as an anchor to the previous discourse.
The principle oldnewprinciple is motivated by this processing convenience [e.g.,][]keenan77.
Clause-initial locatives and other adjectives can also be explained by this motivation.
This anchoring function works best when the activation cost of the referent is relatively high givon83;
i.e.,
when the referent of the element in question is inferable or declining.
When the activation cost is low, i.e., the topic is continuous from the previous discourse,
the element in question that refers to the topic is expected to be zero givon83,gundeletal93,ariel90;
there is no need for anchoring because the topic is already evoked and the hearer expects the topic to be also mentioned in the current sentence.
This explanation predicts that the distance between the element in question and the antecedent is larger when the element in question is expressed in the form of NP instead of zero.
Figure DistExpTypeF appears to support this prediction,
although a statistical analysis indicates that the expression types do not significantly contribute to predict the distance.
This paragraph discusses NPs with long distance.
See the discussion below for NPs with shorter distance.
The whisker plot in Figure DistExpTypeF shows the distance between the element in question (NP vs. (explicit) pronoun vs. zero pronoun) and its antecedent.
It measures the time between when the first mora of the element question is produced and when the first mora of the antecedent is produced.
The figure shows that the distance between NP and the antecedent is larger than that of zero and the antecedent in many cases.
Zero pronouns are assumed to be produced at the time
when the first mora of the predicate is uttered.

exemplifies this pattern,
where zero pronouns are indicated by O.
In line b, san-nin-me `the last person' precedes adjuncts (`last fall') and is coded by a variation of toiuno-wa (ttuuno-wa).
Zero pronouns O are inserted right before the predicate for the purpose of presentation,
but this does not affect the analysis.
Since this person is one of the three people mentioned in line a,
this person is inferable
through a part-whole relation.
The topic moves on to another person in line f, who is also one of the three people mentioned in line a.
In line j, the speaker again refers to the person mentioned in line b.
Also this time, the element moo hitori-wa `the other person' appears near clause-initially, preceding other arguments.
The referent continues to be mentioned until line q.

Finally, the speaker starts talking about himself in line r,
in which case the element boku-wa `1sg-wa' appears near clause-initially.

 . ...
   (S05M1236: 639.40-738.22)
















In this type of example,
clause-initial elements, especially those coded by topic markers, function as an anchor to the previous discourse.

However,
Figure DistExpTypeF also indicates that
(explicit) pronouns (kore `dem.prox (this)', sore `dem.med (this/that)', are `dem.dist (that)', kare `3sg.m (he)', kanozyo `3sg.f (she)')
	 
	Kare `3sg.m (he)' and kanozyo `3sg.f (she)' are very rare in spoken Japanese.
	Instead, kono hito `this person' or similar expressions are used more frequently.
	However, this study does not count them as pronouns.
	
and zero pronouns do not differ from each other.

Moreover, there are NPs which refer to the immediate antecedent.
Whereas more than half of the NPs have longer distance than explicit and zero pronouns,
the figure also shows that many NPs have distances as short as those of explicit and zero pronouns.
In fact, a fixed effects analysis for the distance (the expression type as a fixed effect and the speaker as a random effect) indicates that expression types are not a significant factor to predict the distance.
For example, in the previous example ,
the referent of hitori `one person' in line f is mentioned in line h as sono hito `that person' again,
although the distance is not very far.
	 
	The impression of line g is inserted clause rather than topic shift.
	
In a similar manner,
the referent of san-nin-me in line b is mentioned in the immediately following clause (line c) as soitu `3sg'.
These examples are not mere exceptions.
In fact, 74.1 of secondly mentioned referents are still expressed in the form of an NP;
only 21.4 are expressed as zero and 4.6 as pronoun,
as shown in Table AnaCountExpTypeT and Figure AnaCountExpTypeF.
Figure AnaCountExpTypeF and Table AnaCountExpTypeT show
the expression type of the element in question based on how many times the referent is mentioned.
"2" indicates that the element in question is mentioned second,
"3" indicates that it is mentioned third, and so on.
The ratio of zero increases as the referent keeps being mentioned.
The fact that the referent introduced is mentioned repeatedly is also reported in clancy80, who investigates Pear Stories;
this pattern is not unique to the corpus of the current study.
is another example
of two NPs which refer to the same referent adjacent with each other.
In this example,
the very long word yuugosurabia-syakaisyugi-kyoowakoku `Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia' is repeated twice.

.WO:TopicAppearClause-Initially:Ex:Yuugo
 . ee kon ma kono tiiki ee yu ma kyuu-yuugosurabia-syakaisyugi-kyoowakoku-toiu tokoro-nan-desu-keredomo 

 	fl frg fl this area fl frg fl former-Yugoslavia-socialist-republic-quot place-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

	`This area is called Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'
 . kono yuugosurabia-syakaisyugi-kyoowakoku-tteiuno-wa motomotoga ee minzoku-tairitu-no hagesii tiiki-de-gozai-masi-te 

 	this Yugoslavia-socialist-republic-toiuno-wa originally fl ethnic-conflict-gen severe area-cop-plt-plt-and 

	`this Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is an area with severe ethnic conflicts...'
	S00M0199: 81.95-94.42




Why does the speaker repeat the same referent adjacent with each other,
although s/he can fairly assume that the referent has been already evoked by the first mention?
In fact, the second `Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia' in line b cannot be omitted contrary to what is claimed about the nominal forms givon83,gundeletal93,ariel90.
Why?

Since the most frequent pronoun in Japanese is the zero pronoun as indicated in Figure AnaCountExpTypeF and Table AnaCountExpTypeT,
the speaker needs to make sure that the hearer understand which referent zero pronouns refer to.
Therefore, the speaker needs to establish the referent as a topic
before s/he uses zero.
  
 As pointed out by one of the reviewers (Morimoto),
 it is possible to replace `this Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia' in line b of WO:TopicAppearClause-Initially:Ex:Yuugo with a pronoun-like form such as kono kuni `this country'.
 My argument here still holds because the pronoun-like form `this country' is
 much more informative than the zero pronoun.
 The following argument by lambrecht94 also suggests that
 focus can be the antecedent of overt pronouns, but not zero pronouns.
 See examples WO:TopicAppearClause-Initially:Ex:John and WO:TopicAppearClause-Initially:Ex:Rosa.
 
This might be related to the observation in [136]lambrecht94 that
focus elements cannot be the antecedent of zero,
while topic elements can.
Compare and (the acceptability judgements are based on Lambrecht. Information structure is added by the present author).
In , John is interpreted as topic (by default) in [b],
in which case zero is acceptable.

.WO:TopicAppearClause-Initially:Ex:John
 . John married Rosa, but he didn't really love her.
 . [John] [married Rosa], but O didn't really love her.

On the other hand,
in ,
John is focus because it is the answer to the question,
in which case zero is not acceptable as in [b].
Only an explicit pronoun is acceptable, as shown in [a].

.WO:TopicAppearClause-Initially:Ex:Rosa
 .[Q:] Who married Rosa?
 .[A:]
   .[a.] John married Rosa, but he didn't really love her.
   .[b.] *?[John] [married Rosa], but O didn't really love her.

Why do these pronouns or NPs which refer to the immediate antecedent appear (near) clause-initially?
I argue that, in addition to the from-old-to-new principle oldnewprinciple,
the persistent-element-first principle works in spontaneous speech.

. PerFirstPrinciplePersistent-element-first principle:
 In languages in which word order is relatively free,
 the unmarked word order of constituents is persistent element first and non-persistent element last.

One of the factors which motivate this principle is  clause-chaining.
In spoken Japanese, a chain of clauses is frequently observed as schematized in ,
where the speaker announces the topic at the beginning and continues to talk about it by a chain of multiple clauses.
  
 This is also pointed by Michinori Shimoji (p.c.) on Ryukyuan Languages,
 which belong to the same language family as Japanese.
 


.
 . Topic
 . Clause1
 . Clause2
 . Clause3
 . ...

A specific example of clause-chaining is shown in ,
where the topic `Everest Trail' in line a is preannounced,
and the following clauses (b--f) are about this topic `Everest Trail'.

.
. kono eberesuto-kaidoo-toiuno-wa 

	this Everest-trail-quot-wa 

	`This Everest Trail is'
. tibetto-to nepaaru-no kooeki-ro-ni-mo nat-te ori-masi-te 

	Tibet-com Nepal-gen trade-road-dat-also become-and prog-plt-and 

	`also used for trading  between Tibet and Nepal.'
. ma zissai-wa nihon-de iu-to  

	fl actual-wa Japan-loc say-cond 

	`Say, in Japan for example,'
. O takao-san-mitaina yama-miti-nan-desu-keredomo

	 impression-gen O road-cop.plt-past 

 `it was a road like a trading road for local people.'
 .[] (S01F0151: 105.73-120.14)






This pattern is useful because which referent the speaker talks about in the chain of clauses in question is referred to at the beginning of the chain and s/he can use the zero pronoun in the following clauses.









Figure ExpTypePrevWOF and ExpTypePrevWOZeroF show the word order of antecedents of NPs and zero pronouns, respectively.
Although the contrast is subtle,
the antecedents of zero pronouns are more skewed towards earlier positions than NPs.



Consider the following example .
The speaker mentions the topic `the participants of the trekking' first in line a,
and describes this in the following discourse.
After [f],
the speaker extends the topic and describes each participant.

.trekking
 . e torekking-sankasya-nituki-masite-wa

		`there were many kinds of people from a wide age range and it was interesting.'
		S01F0151: 597.67-610.87





In this kind of example,
clause-initial elements do not refer to zero pronouns as constituents in the following clauses,
but are only pragmatically associated with the constituents in the following clauses (see also Par:Subj:Ex).

Not all clause-initial antecedents of zero pronouns are coded by topic markers.
Figure ExpTypePrevParF is a bar plot of expression types of elements based on the particles of their antecedents.
According to the figure, the antecedents of zero pronouns are more likely to be coded by wa or toiuno-wa than
those of overt NPs,
although there are many antecedents of zeros coded by ga or o.

In the following example ,




















waru-gaki `brats', which is coded by ga clause-initially in line a, is the antecedent of the zero in line b.

.
 . a dokka-no kinzyo-no waru-gaki-ga sute-inu-o mi-te

	`(they) must have painted the dog's nose red.'
 . (we) were talking like this.
 S02M0198: 176.26-184.61


This might sound a priori to some readers because Japanese is traditionally argued to be an SOV language:
of course ga-coded elements are subjects and precede other arguments.
However, what I claim is that
the persistent-element-first principle PerFirstPrinciple, in addition to the from-old-to-new principle oldnewprinciple, is one of the motivations for so-called subjects (A and S) to precede other arguments.




















Another motivation has been pointed out for topic elements immediately repeated clause-initially.
dennakagawa13 discuss cases where clause-initial topics are used as fillers.
Since topics have already been evoked in the speaker's mind, the cost of producing topics is lower than that of producing new elements.
While the speaker utters the topic,
s/he plans the following utterance.
dennakagawa13 investigated conversations and found that the topic elements repeated immediately after the previous speaker's utterance
complementarily distribute with fillers.
They also found that the length of the final mora of the topic phrase (typically wa) correlates with the length of the following utterance
[see also][]watanabeden10.

In the following example ,
not only `Serbian people' is repeated twice in line a and b,
the whole sentence is almost repeated;
the sentences in line a and b convey almost the same proposition.
This is another piece of evidence that supports Den  Nakagawa's claim;
while repeating almost the same proposition,
the speaker can plan what to say next about this topic.

Summary of clause-initial elements

This section investigated characteristics of clause-initial elements.
It turned out that
shared and persistent elements tend to appear clause-initially.
Not only did this study confirm the classic observation that
topics tend to appear clause-initially,
this section and the next section analyze what kind of topics appear clause-initially.
I also discussed motivations for clause-initial topics.




Post-predicate elementsWOPostPreEles

While Japanese is reported to be a verb-final language hinds86,shibatani90,
some elements appear after the verb in spoken Japanese kuno78,onosuzuki92,fujii95,takami95a,takami95b,ono06,nakagawaetal08_paper.
The following are examples of post-predicate elements.
Since post-predicate elements are very rare in monologues,
the examples are from the dialogue part of CSJ.
Kono hito `this person' in and terii itoo `Terry Ito (A person's name)' in are produced after the predicates yat `do' and kake `wear', respectively.

.

This section investigates the information structure of post-predicate constructions of this kind.
Although post-predicate expressions could be adverbs, connectives, and other adjuncts,
this study only examines noun phrases.








Strongly evoked elements appear after predicateWORdis

[][136]takami95a argues that
postposed elements are elements other than the focus.
For example,
the answer to a question or wh-phrase cannot be postposed naturally.
is an example of a postposed element `a 10-carat diamond ring' as the answer to the question `what'.
While the sentence itself is natural,
the postposed element cannot felicitously be the answer to a question.

.
 .[Q:] What did Taro buy for Hanako?
 .[A:] taroo-wa hanako-ni kat-te yat-ta-yo zyuk-karatto-no daiya-no yubiwa-o 

 		Taro-wa Hanako-for buy-and give-past-fp 10-carat-gen diamond-gen ring-o 

		`Taro bought (it) for Hanako, a 10-carat diamond ring.'

Similarly,
wh-phrases such as dore `which' cannot be postposed,
as shown in .

. *itiban oisii-desu-ka dore-ga? 

		most delicious-cop.plt-q which-ga 

		`The most delicious one, which?'




nakagawaetal08_paper found that
there are two types of post-predicate construction:
the single-contour and the double-contour types.
The single-contour type is a type of post-predicate construction
where the post-predicate elements are uttered without a pause and do not have the F peak,
whereas the double-contour type is a type of construction
where the post-predicate elements are uttered with a pause and do have the F peak.
The pitch contours of each utterance are shown in Figure kome1F for the single-contour type ([A] and [A]) and kome2F for the double-contour type ([A] and [A]),
both of which are produced by the author.
The post-predicate part is kome-wa `rice-wa',
whose accent nucleus is on me and overall accent is supposed to be LHL (L indicates low and H indicates high in pitch).
In Figure kome1F, where the postposed element is uttered with the same continuous contour as the main clause,
one can neither observe the F peak in me nor a pause between the predicate and the postposed element.
In Figure kome2F, on the other hand,
where the postposed element is uttered in a separate contour from the main clause,
one can observe the F peak in me and a pause between the predicate and the postposed element.

nakagawaetal08_paper investigated the difference between these two types in terms of information structure and found that
the post-predicate elements of the single-contour type are evoked
by being mentioned immediately before or through physical context.
On the other hand,
those of the double-contour type are not necessarily evoked.
For example, compare the following examples and ,
where the bold-faced letters indicate that
they are high in pitch.
	 
	Here I assume that the pitch accent of oisii `good' is LHHH
	and that of kome-wa `rice-wa' is LHL.
	
The referent `rice' in is evoked
because it is mentioned in [Q] immediately before the answer to Q is uttered.
In this case,
[A],
where the post-predicate element kome-wa `rice-wa' has its own F peak and is preceded by a pause,
is not acceptable,
while [A],
where the post-predicate element without its own F peak is uttered immediately after the predicate without a pause,
is acceptable.

. The referent `rice' evoked
 .[Q:] I don't like rice.
	.[A:] oisii-yo kome-wa 

			good-fp rice-wa 

	.[A:] ?oisii-yo, kome-wa 

			good-fp rice-wa 

			`RICE is good (but others not).'
			[][7]nakagawaetal08_paper

On the other hand,
in , where `rice' is not evoked before the speaker utters [A] or [A],
only the double-contour type [A] is acceptable
and the single-contour type [A] is not natural.
. The referent `rice' not evoked
 .[Q:] Is that sushi bar good?
	.[A:] ??oisii-yo kome-wa 

			good-fp rice-wa 

	.[A:] oisii-yo, kome-wa 

			good-fp rice-wa 

			`RICE is good (but others not).'
			(ibid.)

The remaining issue is
to investigate the difference between elements before and after the predicate in terms of information structure.

nakagawaetal08_paper measured the referential distance (RD) between the post-predicate elements and their antecedents,
i.e., they measured the number of inter-pausal units between the element in question and its antecedent.
They modified the definition of RD from the original one givon83 and decided to use inter-pausal unit as a measure of RD
since clause boundaries are sometimes difficult to identify in spoken Japanese.
Their results are shown in Table RDPostT.
The table shows that the average RD of the post-predicate elements of the single-contour type is 6.9 on average,
whereas that of the double-contour type is 39.7.
What about elements before the predicate?

I conducted the same investigation for elements before the predicate, but this time I used monologues employed throughout this study
because the dialogues Nakagawa and her colleagues used in their study lack the information about RD of elements before the predicate.
	 
	nakagawaetal08_paper counted the RD of non-anaphoric elements as 100 (the maximum value of RD),
	but this study didn't include non-anaphoric elements
	since I thought that this is ad hoc.
	This modification makes the RD of elements before the predicate (conducted in this study) smaller.
	This has only a small effect and the overall conclusion does not change because
	according to our result,
	the RD of pre-predicate elements are larger than that of post-predicate elements;
	if this study employed the same criteria as Nakagawa et al.,
	the RD of elements before the predicate would be expected to be even larger.
	
Further studies are needed to make sure that elements before the predicate in monologues and dialogues have the same characteristics.
Table RDPreT shows the average RDs of elements before the predicate based on their word order.
Here, I simplified word order to only count arguments (excluding fillers, fragments, adverbs, adjectives, etc.).
1 indicates that the element in question is the first argument in a clause,
2 indicates that it is the second argument, and so on.
The RD of the first argument is 20.9 on average,
that of the second argument is 23.0, and
the third is 41.1.

The table indicates that the RDs of elements before the predicate,
regardless of their word orders,
are larger than that of postposed elements of the single-contour type.
The RD of double-contour postposed elements is similar to that of preposed elements in the third position.
I do not have an explanation for the RD of double-contour postposed elements.
I believe that postposed elements of the double-contour type are heterogeneous;
some might be afterthought,
some might have interactional functions ono07,
others might be something else (tanaka05,kakuden12, see also the discussion in WO:PostP:Motiv:Double).
What I want to emphasize here is that the RD of the single-contour postposed elements is smaller than that of elements before the predicate.
The postposed elements of the single-contour type are evoked when they are uttered;
their activation cost is low.
Taking into consideration the fact that
many of the post-predicative elements are pronouns or nouns preceded by demonstratives nakagawaetal08_paper,
I propose that post-predicative elements are often strongly evoked.
On the other hand, the activation cost of preposed elements is higher than that of postposed elements.
  
 The average RD of zero pronouns is 5.0,
 which shows that post-predicate elements of the single-contour type is
 close to zero pronouns.

The following are examples of post-predicate constructions from dialogues.
and are examples of the single-contour type.
The postposed elements of this type are typically pronouns or modified by demonstratives such as kono `dem.prox (this)', sono `dem.med (this/that)', and ano `dem.dist (that)'.
In ,
the postposed element is the pronoun kore `dem.prox (this)'.
The participants are working on a task of ranking famous people based on how much they earn.
The utterance is produced in the middle of this task and
the demonstrative kore refers to the ranking so far.
Therefore, the referent of kore is expected to be evoked in the participants' mind.
As shown in Figure D02F0025_sugoi_tatakaiF,
where the upper box indicates the intensity of the utterance
and the lower box indicates the F,
the postposed element kore does not have a F peak.

. D02F0025_sugoi_tatakai
	.[L:] sugoi tatakai-da-yo-ne kore 

	awful battle-cop-fp-fp this 

	`(It) is an awful battle, this?'
		D02F0025: 463.93-465.81

In ,
where the participants are involved in the same task as ,
kono hito `this person' is the famous person under discussion right now and hence the referent is evoked in the participants' mind.
Figure D02M0028_konohitoF shows the intensity and the F of the utterance .
Although the F of the postposed element is not shown because the speaker's utterance is too quiet,
the intensity tells us that
the postposed part is uttered without a pause.
Also, the fact that the intensity is low indicates that the postposed element is only weakly uttered because the referent is sufficiently evoked.

.D02M0028_konohito
	.[R:] nani yat-teru-no kono hito 

			what do-prog-nmlz this person 

			`What is (he) doing, this person?'
		D02M0028: 193.30-194.45

Common nouns can also be postposed elements of the single-contour type as in .
In , where the participants are again involved in the same task,
the postposed element syasin `photo' is uttered without a pause or F peak, as shown in Figure D02F0015_syasinF.
Since R, the other participant, is physically holding the photos and this is part of their rules of the task,
it is reasonable to assume that the participants have already evoked the photos.

.D02F0015_syasin
	.[L:] siro-kuro-desu-ka syasin

On the other hand,
postposed elements of the double-contour type have not been evoked enough or they are contrastive at the time of utterance.
In , where again the participants are involved in the task of ranking famous people based on their income,
kotti-wa `on my side' is uttered in a separate contour from the main clause and there is a pause between the main clause and the postposed element, as shown in Figure D02F0015_kottiwaF.
`On my side' is necessary information in the sense that
the other participant L was talking about how many people were listed on her own side.
Therefore, the participant R might have thought that `there are ten people' is not enough and added `on my side' later.
The F peak of the postposed kotti-wa `on my side' is still lower than zyuu `ten' in the main clause,
and the intensity is also lower.
This is because the postposed element is not the focus as takami95a,takami95b has pointed out.
Foci are typically new in the given-new taxonomy and need both F peak and intensity in order for the hearer to understand clearly what is said.

.D02F0015_kottiwa
 .[L:] There are eleven people (listed on my side).
 .[R:] zyuu-nin-desu kotti-wa 

 		ten-people-cop.plt this.side-wa 

		`There are ten people on my side.'
	D02F0015: 3.27-9.03











In ,
L is interviewing R about her study on the difference among Japanese dialects.
R utters `western area' in a separate contour from the predicate
because R compares different dialects and, only in the eastern area, did she find no differences among smaller areas (prefectures).
Therefore `the eastern area' is contrasted with other areas.
In this case, the F peak and the intensity of the postposed element are as high as those of the main clause,
as shown in Figure D04F0050_kantooF.

Motivations for topics to appear post-predicativelyWO:PostP:Motivations

It has been pointed out that
topics or given elements tend to appear clause initially mathesius28,firbas64,danes70.
What are the motivations for them to appear post-predicatively?
In this section I mainly discuss the post-predicate elements of the single-contour type in comparison with the elements before the predicate.
Those of the double-contour type are heterogeneous as discussed above and this needs further investigation.



Low activation cost and general characteristics of intonation unitWO:PostP:Motivations:IU

Before getting directly into the question of
why some topics appear post-predicatively,

let us begin with the question of why some topics do not appear clause-initially.
As discussed in GivenAppearClause-Initially and this section,
the activation cost of preposed topics is higher than
those of postposed topics and zero pronouns.
The low activation cost of post-predicate elements suggests that
they are not anchors to the previous discourse;
since they are already evoked enough,
they do not have to relate to the previous contexts and the current utterance.
Therefore, they have the motivations for not appearing clause-initially.
Why do they appear post-predicatively?

I argue that the element whose activation cost is low tends to appear post-predicatively
because, in Japanese and many other languages,
an intonation unit starts from high F and gradually declines toward the end 
libermanpierrehumbert84,cruttenden86,duboisetal93,chafe94,prieto96,truckenbrodt04,denetal10.
Since the elements with low activation cost do not require high F,
their preferred position is toward the last position in an intonation unit.
This kind of phenomenon has already been reported in Siouan, Caddoan, and Iroquoian languages of North America mithun95.
In these languages,
this newsworthy-first (i.e., given-last) word order is fully grammaticalized, and Mithun proposes a hypothesis that the given-last word order comes from right-detachment constructions, namely, the postposed constructions discussed in this section.
She argues that this word order is motivated by the general tendency that intonation units start from high F, which gradually declines.
This tendency of intonation units is physiologically motivated,
as cruttenden86 discusses:

quote
The explanation for declination has often been related to the decline in transglottal pressure as the speaker uses up the breath in his lungs.
A more recent explanation suggests that an upward change of pitch involves a physical adjustment which is more difficult than a downward change of pitch,
the evidence being that a rise takes longer to achieve than a fall of a similar interval in fundamental frequency.
[][168]cruttenden86
quote


Moreover, [][89]comrie89 argues that unstressed constituents such as clitic pronouns are cross-linguistically ``subject to special positioning rules only loosely, if at all, relating to their grammatical relation'';
therefore, he argues that ``sentences with pronouns can be discounted in favour of those with full noun phrases''.


Arguing against the hypothesis givon79
that one can reconstruct ancient word order of a language based on pronominal affixes and clitics,
Comrie suggests that the order of pronominal affixes and clitics in a clause is more likely to be influenced by stress rhythm properties [][218]comrie89.

I argue that the order of Japanese unstressed pronouns and NPs is also affected by phonetic constraints as Comrie suggests.
As will be discussed in Chapter Intonation,
some unstressed pronouns and NPs referring to highly evoked entities
lose pitch peaks and are produced only in low pitch.
However, an accent rule in Japanese does not allow lexical items to start with two low pitch morae in a row.
Therefore, the best position for unstressed items is the sentence-final or post-predicate position,
which allows unstressed items to appear.
For phonetic analysis of unstressed items,
see Chapter Intonation.



Why the post-predicate construction mainly appears in dialogue and what the source of ``emotive'' usage is

The declination of F does not fully explain post-predicate constructions in Japanese.

The discussion above does not explain why the Japanese post-predicate construction mainly appears in dialogues, but not in monologues.
Moreover, Japanese post-predicate constructions are reported to have ``emotive'' characteristics ono07.
As examples for emotive characteristics of post-predicate constructions, consider the following constructed example.
Let us assume that a boy gave a present to his girlfriend.
The girl happily received the gift and opened it.
After seeing the gift, say a banana case,
	 
	Bananas of all sizes can fit into this banana case.
	
she uttered or .
Since the most frequent word order in Japanese is predicate-final,
the canonical order is and
can be regarded as a post-predicate construction.

.korenanikore nani 

	this what 

	`What's this?'
	(Canonical word order)

.nanikorenani kore 

	what this 

	`What's this (weird thing)?'
	(Post-predicate construction)

These two utterances consist of the same constituents kore `this' and nani `what'.
As was pointed out in onosuzuki92 and ono07,
however, the implicatures of these two are different.
In ,
she simply does not know what she received,
probably because she has never seen it before.
By contrast, in ,
she knows what she received (it's a banana case) but she did not like it, as we expected.
In other contexts, can be used to express the speaker's surprise,
excitement, etc.
However, can never be a neutral question.
Where does this implicature come from?

Since these two utterances consist of exactly the same elements,
it is obvious that the implicature in cannot be derived from the meaning of each constituent.
In this study, I propose two factors involved in the questions of why post-predicate constructions mainly appear in dialogues and of what the source of this ``emotive'' usage is:
word order and intonation.

Firstly, I discuss why the post-predicate construction appears mainly in dialogues.
My point is that,
since the intonation-unit-final position is a position for expressions with interactional functions,
the post-predicate element (of the single-contour type) plays some interactional role.
As has traditionally been argued [e.g.,][]watanabe71,
the post-predicate position is for interaction in Japanese.
iwasaki93 extended this argument and claimed that
in fact the intonation-unit-final position is the position for interaction;
the post-predicate position is only one example of this intonation-unit-final position.
Consider the following example.
Each line corresponds to a single intonation unit.
The lines a, b, and c end with interactional markers ne and sa,
which is indicated by IT.
As examples show,
these interactional markers appear IU-finally.
	 
	IT stands for ``interactional component'',
	one of four types of components in an intonation unit.
	Other types are:
	LD (lead component (e.g., fillers)),
	ID (ideational component), and

	CO (cohesive component).
	The order of an intonation unit is proposed to be
	LD ID CO IT in Japanese [][44]iwasaki93.
	

.
 .
 sooiu sito-ga siki si-te-ne 

 	such person-ga lead do-and-fp 

	ID ID ID ID-CO-IT	 

	`Such people led, and'
 .
 sinin-o asoko-e minna-ne 

 		corpses-o there-dir all-fp 

		ID ID ID-IT 


 .
 ano dote-no ue-e-sa 

 		that bank-gen top-dir-fp 

		ID ID ID-ID-IT 


 atsume-te 

 		gather-and 

		ID-CO 

	`gathered dead bodies on top of that bank...'
	[][47, gloss and transcription modified by the current author]iwasaki93

As morita05 suggests,
a general function of interactional particles such as ne and sa is ``to foreground a certain stretch of talk as an `interactionally relevant unit' to be operated on
-- whether that unit is itself a whole utterance or merely one particular component of that utterance'' (p. 92).
Since the post-predicate elements follows these interactional particles within the same intonation unit as in D02F0015_TerryIto and D02F0025_sugoi_tatakai,
where the post-predicate elements follow ne,
they are also expected to have some interactional functions.
kakuden12 report that
77.6 of the post-predicate constructions have interactional particles of this kind after the predicate,
whereas only 47.0  of the non-post-predicate constructions have interactional particles.
This also suggests that post-predicate constructions are related to
some interactional characteristics.
Further investigation is necessary for the question of what kind of interactional functions they have,
possibly employing conversational analysis.

Secondly,
I argue that 
the source of ``emotive'' implicature of nanikore in contrast with korenani comes from the intonational constraint of the post-predicate element.
In Japanese, wh-questions can be optionally uttered with rising intonation.

However, the post-predicate element is always falling and the rising intonation is not natural.
Figure nanikoreF shows the pitch contour of the utterance nani kore `what's this (weird thing)?' nanikore,
while Figure korenaniF shows the pitch contour of neutral order kore nani `what's this?' korenani.
As indicated in the figures, the neutral word order korenani in Figure korenaniF is uttered with rising intonation,
and I believe that this is the most frequent intonation,
whereas the post-predicate construction nanikore in Figure nanikoreF is falling intonation,
in which case it is impossible to utter kore with rising intonation.

It is this constraint on the intonation of post-predicate elements that yields the emotive implicature of the utterance nanikore.
In fact, the neutral word order kore nani can be uttered in falling intonation, as shown in Figure korenani_fallF.
In this case, as predicted from the discussion, the falling intonation conveys emotion of the speaker.
It is possible for nani `what' in nanikore to be uttered with rising intonation as indicated in Figure nanikore_riseF,
in which case the emotive nuance of nanikore disappears.

Post-predicate elements with double-contour typeWO:PostP:Motiv:Double

Finally, in this section,
I briefly mention intriguing studies on post-predicate constructions,
which I assume belong to the double-contour type.
The first study is kakuden12.
They investigated whether the hearer responds (including back-channel responses) to the speaker near and after the predicate and showed that
the speaker adds post-predicate elements
when the hearer does not respond to the predicate.
Their further analysis suggests that the speaker produces post-predicate elements to acquire the hearer's response and to achieve mutual belief.
Let us see example ,
which comes from the dialogue part of CSJ they employed.
The duration of silence is shown in seconds inside parentheses
since it is important for the discussion.
In [-L2], where the speaker postposes the element kono kenkyuu `this study',
there are pauses between the verb phrase and the postposed demonstrative kono `this' and between the demonstrative and the postposed NP kenkyuu `study',
which is enough time for L to realize that
R does not respond to L.
Note that R, the listener of the postposed construction,
does not respond until 604.33 seconds,
0.32 seconds after L finished the post-predicate part.
Also note that
these pauses differentiate post-predicate constructions of the double-contour type from those of the single-contour type.

Summary of post-predicate elements

In this section
I investigated post-predicate elements.
It turned out that
the activation costs of postposed elements are much lower than
that of preposed elements,
which appear before the predicate.
This suggests that topics also appear post-predicatively.
I also discussed why
topics appear post-predicatively as well as clause-initially
in terms of the shape of intonation and its constraints on Japanese grammar.

The characteristic found in this study is one of many features of post-predicate elements.
In future research,
it is necessary to explore how these features are related to each other.




Pre-predicate elementsWOPrePredEles

This section discusses pre-predicate elements,
which appear immediately before the predicate.
In WO:PreP:New,
I show results which indicate that
new, namely focus elements, elements tend to appear right before the predicate.
In WO:PreP:Motivation,
I discuss motivations for focus elements to appear near the predicate.

New elements appear right before predicateWO:PreP:New























As shown in Figure DEPositionISF and DiffInfoStatusF,
which are repeated here for convenience as Figure DEPositionISF2 and DiffInfoStatusF2, respectively,
new elements or focus elements tend to appear immediately before the predicate.
Figure DEPositionISF2 shows the element position based on their information status including all expressions such as fillers, adjectives, and so on;
Figure DiffInfoStatusF2 shows the distance between the element and the predicate based on their information status.


As indicated in Figure DEPositionISF2,
the distribution of anaphoric elements is skewed towards clause-initial position,
whereas that of non-anaphoric elements is not.
Taking Figure DiffInfoStatusF2 into this account as well,
we can see that many of new elements appear immediately before the predicate.







As discussed in WO:Intro, the mixed effects model of information status (the distance between the predicate and the element in question) shows that
the contribution of the distance is only marginally significant.
However, a further analysis implies that the distance is also a significant factor for predicting information status.
As is clear from Table ParInfoStatusCTT and Par:InfoStatusPar:LSMEANST,
datives tend to code new elements (especially, as opposed to wa).
Datives can appear anywhere, from pre-predicate to clause-initial positions,
which is shown in Figure WO:Prep:New:DiffASPF.


Therefore, I tentatively conclude that the distance between the predicate and the element in question (excluding ni-coded elements) is an important factor for information status and
new elements appear before the predicate.
This supports a classic observation in other languages that focus appears closely with the predicate (bresnan94,morimoto99 on Bantu languages, jacennikdryer92 on Polish, erguvanli84 on Turkish, see morimoto00 for a summary of studies on both VO and OV languages).
Further studies are necessary to obtain conclusive evidence.

The following are example of non-anaphoric elements appearing close to the predicate.
and are examples of non-anaphoric P occurring immediately before the predicate.
In ,
kyoomi `interest' appear immediately before the predicate moti `have',
and, in ,
aidenthithii `identity' in line a, inoti `life' in line b, and ti `blood' in line c appear right before the prediates kake `risk' and nagasi `bleed', respectively.
Non-anaphoric Ps are typically abstract concepts like kyoomi `interest' in , aidenthithii `identity' in [a], and inoti `life' in [b], or
indefinite like ti `blood' in [c].

	S00M0199: 343.53-351.77


Non-anaphoric S elements also appear immediately before the predicate.
They tend to be abstract or indefinite like non-anaphoric Ps.
In ,
kanzi `impression' is the only argument of the predicate tigau `differ' and hence is S,
which is an abstract concept.
This appears immediately before the predicate.

		S05M1236: 578.30-581.49




Motivations for focus to appear close to predicateWO:PreP:Motivation


I argue that the information-structure continuity principle IScontinuityP is also at work here, which is repeated below as for the purpose of convenience.

. IScontinuityP2Information-structure continuity principle:
 A unit of information structure is continuous in a clause;
 i.e., elements which belong to the same unit are adjacent with each other.

I assume that
most frequently the predicate is in the domain of focus lambrecht94,
optionally with one focus element.
Since the predicate and the new element are in the same domain of focus,
they appear together most frequently.

In fact, few studies pay attention to the information status (and namely information structure) of predicates.
	 
	hopperthompson80 is an important exception.
	
Unfortunately this study is not an exception.
Typically definite markers such as the in English and der in German attach to nouns, not to verbs.
Also topic markers such as wa in Japanese typically attach to nouns.
Therefore, nouns have attracted more attention than verbs.
Typically verbs are followed by tense or aspect markers, subordinate-clause markers, realis vs. irrealis markers, and so on.
I believe that these verbal markers are also related to information structure,
but this is beyond the scope of this study.

However,
it is obvious that argument-focus structure,
where the predicate is not in the domain of focus,
is the least frequent type among all three types (predicate-focus, sentence-focus, and argument-focus structures).
Given that the corpus employed in this study consists of monologues, it is to be expected that there are even fewer examples of argument-focus structures because these structures typically appear as the answer to a who/what question, as shown in where the capital letters indicate prominence.

.
 .[Q:] Who went to school?
 .[A:] [The CHILDREN] [went to school].
 [][121]lambrecht94

Since there are no (explicit) questions in monologues,
we find fewer argument-focus structures.

Another context in which sentences with argument-focus structure appear is the ``A not B'' context.
In monologue, ``A not B'' contexts typically appear in self-repair,
which is also rare in our relatively smooth monologues.
Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that the predicate is in the domain of focus most of the time,
and I argue that the information-structure continuity principle IScontinuityP2 explains why new elements (i.e., focus elements) tend to appear immediately before the predicate.

One piece of evidence that supports the information-structure continuity principle is the fact that
it is difficult for presupposed elements to appear immediately before the predicate,
interrupting the focus domain.
Compare [A] and [A],
which are assumed to be the answers to the question [Q].
	 
	Note that they are not a perfect minimal pair because of the accusative marker of o.
	The presence or absence of o is determined by word order and
	information structure is a kind of side effect in this case.
	See the discussion in CasePar for more detail.
	
In [A],
the presupposed elements taroo-ni `to Taro' and hanako-ni `to Hanako' are interrupting the domain of focus `gave a travel ticket' and `gave a cake'.
Therefore this sentence is not acceptable.
Conversely, in [A],
the presupposed elements do not intervene the domain of focus and hence this is acceptable.

.
 .[Q:] What did you do for Taro and Hanako for their birthdays?
 .[A:] ?[ryokoo-ken-o] [taroo-ni] [age-te] [keeki-o] [hanako-ni] [tukut-te age-ta]-yo 

 			travel-ticket-o Taro-dat give-and cake-o Hanako-dat make-and give-past-fp 

			`(I) gave travel tickets to Taro and gave cake to Hanako.'
 .[A:] [taroo-ni] [ryokoo-ken age-te] [hanako-ni] [keeki tukut-te age-ta]-yo 

 			Taro-dat travel-ticket give-and Hanako-dat cake make-and give-past-fp 

			`(I) gave travel Taro travel tickets and gave Hanako cake.'

A more natural context for [A] is where Q asks
what A did for the travel ticket and the cake.
kuno78 proposes that
the pre-predicate position is for new elements,
but he limits this principle to cases
where the predicate is given.

.
 In cases where the predicate is given,
 the position immediately before the predicate is the position for new.
 [][60, translated by the current author]kuno78

I argue that this observation also applies to cases where the predicate is new.

Moreover,
as will be discussed in Chapter Intonation,
the domain of focus is uttered in a single intonation unit,
whereas the topic is uttered separately from the domain of focus.
Figure S00M0199_aidenthithiF to S00F0014_kanziF show
the pitch contours of examples S00M0199_inoti and S00F0014_kanzi we discussed in the last section.
As we can see,
there is no pause between the predicate and the previous element and
the pitch range is larger in the elements than in the predicates.
In Figure S00M0199_tiF,
it is difficult to see the pitch range because ti `blood' does not have accent nucleus.
From the first lowering of na in nagasi-ta `bled' being cancelled,
	 
	The pitch accent of nagasi-ta is LHLL.
	
one can see that
ti-o `blood-o' and nagasi-ta `bleed' form a single intonation unit.

Summary of pre-predicate elements

The results of this section showed that
new elements, namely focus elements, tend to appear right before the predicate.
A similar claim has been made by kuno78 and endo14
through constructed examples.
This study supported their claim by examining naturally occurring utterances.
I also discussed motivations for the focus to appear right before the predicate.



DiscussionWODiscussion

This section first discusses possible confounding effects on word order in Japanese,
in particular in association with basic word order (WO:Dis:Confounding).
Second,
I discuss Givon's topicality hierarchy (WO:Dis:Givon).
I provide some counter-examples of this hierarchy and
propose to modify it.
Finally, 
I discuss the implications of this study's findings as regards word order typology (WO:Dis:WOTypology).

It is necessary to take other features into account
to see the exact effect of topichood and focushood on word order.

Especially, the effect of ``basic word order'' should not be ignored.


Here I provide some evidence to support my argument that
information structure contributes to word order in spoken Japanese.
Figure DEPositionASPAF to DEPositionASPDATF show
word order and information status of each type of grammatical function (A, S, P, and dative).
These figures indicate that
anaphoric elements of all grammatical function types are still more likely to appear earlier in a clause than new elements.
A and S are more likely to appear earlier in a clause than P because of the basic word order.
However, my argument still holds for the same grammatical function types.
In cases with new elements,
one can see the effect of basic word order;
the peak of S is 4,
which means the 4th position is the most popular for new S (Figure DEPositionASPSF),
whereas the peak of P is 6, which means the 6th position is the most popular for new P (Figure DEPositionASPPF).
The distribution of A is not clear because there are few examples.
But the trend still seems to hold for A.


Givon's topicality hierarchy and word orderWO:Dis:Givon

givon83 proposes a hierarchy of topicality (terminology modified by the author).
``RD'' refers to referential distance,
which is one of the approximations to measure topicality.
Low RD means high topicality,
while high RD means low topicality.

.TopicHierarchy
 .[] High RD
 . Referential indefinite NPs
 . Cleft/focus constructions
 . Y-moved NPs (`contrastive topicalization')
 . Preposed definite NPs
 . Neutral-ordered definite NPs
 . Postposed definite NPs
 . Stressed/independent pronouns
 . Unstressed/bound pronouns or grammatical agreement
 . Zero anaphora
 .[] Low RD
 [][7]givon83

Here I point out two counter-examples against this hierarchy.
First,
as has already been shown in Table RDPostT and RDPreT,
which are repeated as Table RDPostT2 and RDPreT2 for convenience,
the average RD of elements in the clause-initial position (20.9) is lower than that in the second (23.0) or third positions (41.1).
To see this more in detail,
I divided the result of Table RDPreT2 based on grammatical function.
This is shown in Table RDASP.
Regardless of whether the element is A, S, or P,
the overall tendency is that
the elements closer to the predicate have higher average RD.
  
 For now I do not have an explanation for S in the second position.
 It is necessary to test whether the difference between Ss in the first and the second positions is statistically significant or not.
 

The topicality hierarchy TopicHierarchy predicts that
clause-initial elements (d in TopicHierarchy) is lower RD than that of elements in the neutral-ordered position (e in TopicHierarchy).
	 
	I assume that all elements that have antecedents (and namely RDs) are definite.
	
Especially P is against the topicality hierarchy TopicHierarchy,
according to which P in the second or third positions should have lower RD than P in the first position because the neutral position of P is the second or third positions in Japanese.
But this is not the case.
At least in Japanese,
the data show that
elements closer to the predicate have higher RDs
because the pre-predicate position is for focus and hence new elements.

Second,
the average RD of zero pronouns is as high as that of postposed NPs
according to Table RDPostExpTypeT and RDPreExpTypeT.
This is against the topicality hierarchy TopicHierarchy
because it states that
preposed definite NPs (d in TopicHierarchy) and neutral-ordered definite NPs (e in TopicHierarchy) have
higher RDs than
postposed definite NPs.
As discussed above,
elements are postposed for interactional purposes and/or intonational reason.

The final point is an additional suggestion of TopicHierarchy rather than a counter-example.
The RD of postposed elements of the double-contour type is much higher than Givon predicts.
As will be argued in Chapter Intonation,
a unit of information structure corresponds to a unit of intonation.
Since postposed elements of the single-contour type by definition belong to the same intonation unit as the main predicate,
the predicate and the postposed element form a single unit (construction) and postposed elements are relatively homogeneous and easy to characterize.
However,
postposed elements of the double-contour type are heterogeneous as discussed above and are difficult to characterize
because the element itself corresponds to a single unit.
The motivations for such elements to be uttered are heterogeneous.
The functions of such postposed elements are determined by the sequence of conversation.



Information structure and word order typologyWO:Dis:WOTypology

Since most frequent focus elements are patients according to the correlating features ISFeatures,
which is repeated as ,
the information-structure continuity principle IScontinuityP predicts that cross-linguistically
P (the patient-like argument in a transitive clause) and V (the predicate) tend to appear together most frequently and,
if the word order is fixed in the language in question,
P and V tend to appear together.

In fact this has already been claimed and tested in [Chapter 4]tomlin86.
Tomlin proposes this claim as Verb-Object Bonding.

. Verb-Object Bonding (VOB):
	the object of a transitive verb is more tightly bounded to the verb
	than is its subject.
	[][74]tomlin86


He also states that
``[e]xactly why there should be such a bond between a transitive verb and its object is not entirely clear'' (ibid.).
I propose the information-structure continuity principle
for the motivation of such bond.
He enumerates many cross-linguistic pieces of evidence that support VOB.
I introduce a few of them to keep the discussion simple.

First,
in many languages,
there exists some clause-level phonological behavior
(reductions or sandhis) which occur between object and verb,
but not between subject and verb (op. cit., p. 97).
In French, for example,
liaison does not occur between the subject and the transitive verb,
but it does between the object and the verb [see also][]selkirk72.
There is no liaison between the subject les gens and the verb achetent as in ,
whereas there can be liaison between the verb donnerons and the object une pomme as in .


.
 . 
	les gens achetent beaucoup de ca 

	le Za aSEt boku d@ sa 

	the people buy.3pl much of that 

	`Those people buy a lot of that.' (no liaison)
 . *le Za zaSEt boku d@ sa 
 		 (*liaison)

.
 . 
	nous donnerons une pomme a notre mere 

  	nu dOn@ro zyn pOm a notr mEr 

	we give.3pl a apple to our mother 

	`We will give an apple to our mother.'
	(liaison)
flushright
[][pp. 98-99, transcription modified based on standard French]tomlin86
flushright

Another case is Yoruba (Niger-Congo) vowel deletion [from][]bamgbose64.
In verb-noun sequences of this language,
when the object begins with a vowel,
the last vowel of the verb is sometimes deleted.
This happens between verb and object, but not between subject and verb.

.
 . gbe + odo  gb'odo 

		brought + motor 

 . jE iyOn  j'iyOn 

 		eat pounded.yam 

 . Se owo  S'owo 

 		do trade 

		[][pp. 29--30]bamgbose64

These phonological phenomena in French and Yoruba suggest that
the object and predicate are bound more tightly than the subject and predicate.
In a similar manner,
in Japanese,
the focus element and the predicate form a single intonation unit,
but the topic element and the predicate do not,
as we will see in Chapter Intonation.

The second piece of evidence that supports VOB is noun incorporation.
In Mokilese (Oceanic), for example,
there is a set of verbs into which an indefinite object may be incorporated [from][]harrison76.
[a] is a transitive clause with definite object,
which is not incorporated into the verb,
whereas [b] is a clause with indefinite object,
which is incorporated into the verb.
Note that the incorporate object rimeh `bottle' in [b] is between the verb and the aspect suffix la.

.
 . ngoah audoh-la rimeh-i 

		1sg fill-pfv bottle-this 

		`I filled this bottle.'
 . ngoah audohd rimeh-la 

		1sg fill bottle-pfv 

		`I filled bottles.'
		[162]harrison76

Similarly,
compare [a] and [b].
[a] is a case where the object suhkoah `tree' is definite and is not incorporated,
while [b] is a case where the object is indefinite and is incorporated into the verb.
.
 . ngoah poadok-di suhkoah-i 

 	1sg plant-pfv tree-this 

	`I planted this tree'
 . ngoah poad suhkoah-di 

 	1sg plant tree-pfv 

	`I planted trees.'
	(ibid.)

As mithun84 observes,
in some languages patient S can also be incorporated into verbs
but languages allows patient S-incorporation also allows P-incorporation (See also baker88).

Namely, there is a universal hierarchy as in .
The last two (agent S and A) are in brackets because
they are not attested.

. NIhierarchyP  patient S ( agent S  A)

In Southern Tiwa (Tanoan), for example,
the patient Ss `dipper' and `snow' are incorporated as in ,
while the agent Ss such as `dog' cannot be incorporated as in .
	. . l-k'uru-k'euwe-m 

			B-dipper-old-pres 

			`The dipper is old.'
		. we-fan-lur-mi 

			C.neg-snow-fall-pres.neg

			dog-suf A-run-pres 

			`The dog is running.'
		. *O-khwien-teurawe-we 

			A-dog-run-pres 

			`The dog is running.'
			(agent S)
		.[] allenetal84,baker88

In Japanese,
kageyama93 reports that
patient S and P (in his terminology, internal arguments) are widely incorporated into verbs and form noun-verb compounds.
He also reports the existence of agent S and A (external arguments) incorporated into verbs,
but claims that they are exceptional.

The hierarchy of noun incorporation NIhierarchy is similar to the hierarchy of zero-marking in Japanese.
This is because
they are both hierarchy based on focus structure (see also Disc:HardConst).

Finally, VOB and the information-structure continuity principle with correlating features of information structure ISFeatures predict that
cross-linguistically,
P and V appear together most frequently.
Table wals-81 shows the order of subject (S in the table, A in our term), object (O in the table, P in our term), and verb wals-81.
``[O]ne order is considered dominant if text counts reveal it to be more than twice as common as the next most frequent order; if no order has this property, then the language is treated as lacking a dominant order for that set of elements '' wals-s6.
The table shows that
SOV and SVO are the most popular dominant word order among all other possibilities as predicted,
while the next popular order is VSO,
which is against our prediction.
However, note that in deciding which word order is dominant in a language,
Dryer included only
``a transitive clause, more specifically declarative clauses in which both the subject and object involve a noun (and not just a pronoun)'' wals-81.
Therefore, this dominant word order might not be of predicate-focus structure.
Since both of the full noun phrases can be new,
the clause might be of sentence-focus structure.
dryer97 (as well as wals-81) points out that
transitive clauses with full lexical nouns do not occur frequently;
it is more common that
one of the two arguments is pronominal,
which is more likely to be of predicate-focus structure.
For now,
cross-linguistic examination of word orders controlling information structure is very difficult
and I leave this problem for future studies.

Summary


Summary of this chapter

This chapter analyzed associations between word order and information structure in spoken Japanese.
I made it clear that
shared topics appear clause-initially,
while strongly evoked topics appear post-predicatively.
Also, new, i.e., focus, elements appear immediately before the predicate.
Based on these findings,
I proposed the information-structure continuity principle,
in addition to from-old-to-new principle and persistent-element-first principle.



Remaining issues

As I briefly discussed in WO:Dis:Confounding,
information structure is not the only feature contributing to word order in spoken Japanese.
It is necessary to employ statistical analyses.












IntonationIntonation












IntroductionInt:PIUCIU

This chapter investigates the relation between information structure and intonation units.
I propose that
an intonation unit corresponds to a chunk of information, which often corresponds to a unit of information structure.
I employ two methods;
one is a corpus study that I have employed in the previous chapters (Int:IUISUnitCorp),
and the other is a production experiment, where I ask native speakers of Japanese to read aloud sentences and measure F of their speech (Int:IUISUnitExp).
From these findings and the results of the experimental study,
I propose principles governing intonation (Int:Disc).


Before going into the analyses,
I discuss two types of intonation units (IUs) investigated in this study:
phrasal IU and clausal IU.
For the definition of intonation units,
see BackSubIntonation.




I assume that there are many factors to determine IUs
and it is impossible to investigate all of them.
To study information structure factors determining IUs,
I distinguish two types of intonation units:
phrasal IU and clausal IU.
A phrasal IU is an IU where an element (NP regardless of grammatical functions) is uttered in an IU separate from its predicate, whereas
a clausal IU is an IU where an element is uttered in the same IU as its predicate.
IUs where elements themselves are predicates are excluded from the analysis.
Phrasal and clausal IUs are schematized as in ,
where an IU corresponds to a box.

.
 . Phrasal IU: NP Predicate
 . Clausal IU: NP Predicate

The motivations for this distinction come from the observation that IUs in Japanese are more frequently smaller units than a clause iwasaki93,
while IUs in English often correspond to a clause chafe94.
This distinction is also employed in [Chapter 4]matsumoto03,
who investigated intonation units in Japanese in terms of information flow.
is an example of a Japanese IU,
where a single line corresponds to a single IU.

.
 . atasi-wa-ne 

 		1sg-wa-fp 

 . uti-de kii-ta-no-ne 

 	home-loc listen-past-nmlz-fp 

 . sono are-wa-ne 

 	fl that-wa-fp 

 . hoosoo-wa-ne 

 	broadcast-wa-fp

 . kazoku-de 

 	family-with 

	`I listened to the broadcast at home with my family.'
	[][p. 40]iwasaki93

Iwasaki states that IUs in are typical examples in Japanese.
An IU corresponds to a phrase rather than a clause.
Note that the definitions of IU in iwasaki93 and matsumoto03 are different from those in denetal10 and denetal11 employed in this study,
while they share some similarities.
In this particular example ,
most IUs end with the discourse particle ne,
which often appears IU-finally also in the criteria of Den et al.

This section explores the associations between IUs and information structure by investigating our corpus.
I will argue that, in general, topics tend to be uttered in phrasal IUs (Int:IUISUnitCorp:Topic),
while foci tend to be produced in clausal IUs (Int:IUISUnitCorp:Focus).
I also discuss exceptional cases for each tendency.

Table IUInfoStatusT and Figure IUInfoStatusF show the distribution of phrasal vs. clausal IUs
in different information statuses (anaphoric vs. non-anaphoric).
Anaphoric elements refer to those whose referents have been mentioned in the previous discourse,
whereas non-anaphoric elements refer to those whose referents have newly been mentioned
(see FW:Cor:TopFoc for the annotation procedure more in detail).
A linear mixed effects model was employed to predict information status, as we have seen in TopPar and WO:Intro.
Intonation (phrasal vs. clausal IU), particles (toiuno-wa, wa, mo, ga, o, ni), and word order (nth in CSJ, see WO:Intro for the definition of this annotation) are included as fixed effects, and
the speaker (TalkID in the corpus) is included as a random effect.
The model with the effects of intonation, particles, and word order is significantly different from that without each of them (likelihood ratio test,  without intonation,  a model without particles, and  that without word order).



Table IUPerT and Figure IUPerF show the distribution of phrasal vs. clausal IUs in terms of persistence
(persistent vs. non-persistent).
Persistent elements are those whose referents are to be mentioned again in the following discourse,
whereas non-persistent elements are those whose referents are not to be mentioned.
Again a linear mixed effects model was applied to predict persistence, as discussed in TopPar and WO:Intro.
Intonation, particles, and word order are included as fixed effects and
the speaker as a random effect.
The model with the effects of particles, word order, and intonation is not significantly different from that without the effect of intonation (), whereas
it is significantly different from the model without each of the effects of particles and word order (likelihood ratio test,  a model without particles,  that without word order).



Topics tend to be uttered in phrasal IUsInt:IUISUnitCorp:Topic

This section and the next section
discuss associations between topics and IUs and
argue that
evoked, inferable, declining and unused topics tend to be uttered in phrasal IUs (Int:Cor:Topic:PIU, Int:Cor:InacTopic:PIU).
I also claim that some strongly evoked topics, especially pronouns, are in fact part of the following IU
and should be counted as clausal IUs
by modifying the definitions of IU (Int:Cor:Topic:CIU).
It also discusses exceptional cases where topics appear in clausal IUs (TopCIU).
I will argue that topics to be established tend to be uttered in phrasal IUs (Int:Disc).

Evoked, inferable, and declining elements with topic markers in phrasal IUsInt:Cor:Topic:PIU

As Table IUInfoStatusT, Figure IUInfoStatusF, and the results of statistical analysis indicate,

anaphoric elements are more likely to be uttered in phrasal IUs.
Also, Table IUParT and Figure IUParF show that
elements with topic markers such as toiuno-wa and wa are more likely to be in phrasal IUs than those with case markers.
Elements with topic markers are uttered in phrasal IUs most of the time,
while the ratio of elements with case markers (without topic markers) in clausal IUs is larger.
These observations indicate that
at least evoked and inferable topics tend to be produced in phrasal IUs.
This conclusion results from the observation that
elements coded by topic markers such as toiuno-wa and wa
are evoked or inferable elements as argued for in Chapter Particles.
Below I show that declining elements are also uttered in phrasal IUs.
I will argue that strongly evoked elements, especially pronouns, are in fact part of the following IUs,
although in the current criteria they are included in phrasal IUs,
and should be counted as phrasal IUs in Int:Cor:Topic:CIU.

exemplifies an evoked element with topic marker
uttered in a phrasal IU
(``'' indicates IU boundaries).
In this talk, the speaker is talking about his former job,
collecting debt from people.
There is an IU boundary after kaisyuu hoohoo-wa `collecting method-wa', the element coded by a topic marker.
kaisyuu hoohoo `collecting method' is evoked because
it is mentioned in the immediate context
as indicated by koo it-ta `this way of'.

.S00M0221_kaishuukoo it-ta  kaisyuu hoohoo-wa  mazui-to  

	this.way say-past  collecting method-wa  wrong-quot

Figure S00M0221_kaishuuF shows the pitch contour of .
In the figure,
one can observe a pitch reset in the first mora of the predicate mazui `wrong'.

is another example,
where the speaker is talking about his dog,
who had epilepsy.
There is an IU boundary after byooki-wa `disease-wa'.
Byooki `disesase' is also evoked because it is mentioned in the immediate context
as indicated by the demonstrative sono `that'.

.S02M0198_tenkansono byooki-wa  kokuhuku si-masi-te  

		that disease-wa  overcome do-plt-and  

		`(The speaker's dog) overcame that disease.'

The pitch contour of is shown in Figure S02M0198_tenkanF.
In the figure,
one can observe not only a pitch reset,
but also falling intonation,
which typically occurs IU-finally.

is an example of toiuno-wa-coded element uttered in a phrasal IU.
The pitch contour is shown in Figure S00F0014_hawaiiF.
Hawai-too `Hawaii island' is also evoked
as is clear from the demonstrative kono `this'.

		then this  Hawaii-island-toiuno-wa  how place-q say-plt-cond  

		`What kind of place is this Hawaii island?'
		S00F0014: 166.53-169.71


As shown in the figure,
one can observe the pitch reset in the first mora of the predicate don'na `how'.

Similarly,
the inferable element yomee-wa `life.expectancy-wa' is produced in a phrasal IU as indicated in Figure S02F0100_yomeeF.
Yomee `life.expectancy' is inferable
because the speaker is talking about her disease and
it is reasonable to assume that life expectancy is part of the knowledge about disease.

.S02F0100_yomeeosoraku  yomee-wa  zyuu-nen  -da-to  iwa-re-masi-ta 

      probably  life.expectancy-wa  ten-cl.year  -cop-quot  say-pass-plt-past 

      `(I) was told that (my) life expectancy was 10 years.'
      S02F0010: 312.22-314.91



Declining elements are also produced in phrasal IUs rather than clausal IUs.
Consider the following example.
In ,
two competing topics, meisei `fame' and sigoto `job',
are introduced in line a.
Then, the speaker starts to talk about fame first and moves onto `job' in line g,
where the topic sigoto `job' is considered to be declining.
In this case, there is an intonation-unit boundary after sigoto-no bubun-na-n-desu-keredomo `concerning the other one, job'.

.
 . I have two goals: one is for fame and the other is for job.
 . Concerning fame,
 . I have been participating in various piano competitions

Unused elements with topic markers in phrasal IUsInt:Cor:InacTopic:PIU

Unused elements with topic markers also tend to be uttered in
phrasal IUs.
Elements coded by a copula plus kedo or ga appear
in phrasal IUs most of the time.
For example, in [a],
the element sutairu `style', which is introduced for the first time,
are produced in a phrasal IU.
	 
	In fact, the predicate of `style' is not clear in this example.
	This is a general characteristics of topics.
	See discussion in Par:Subj:Ex for more detail.
	

.
 . nde  ee  kono  tabi-no  sutairu  -tteiu mono-na-n-desu-keredomo  

      and  fl  this  travel-gen  style  -toiu thing-cop-nmlz-cop.plt-though 

      `Regarding my style of travelling,'
 . uh, I'm kind of getting used to travelling,
 . uh, I want to travel cheaply and
 . go anywhere freely by myself,
 . that was my style of travelling, so...
     S00F0014: 300.43-317.95



Similarly,
in [a],
kandoo `emotion' is mentioned for the first time and
is produced in a phrasal IU.

.
 . de eberesuto-o mi-ta kandoo-na-n-desu-keredomo  

      and Everest-o see-past emotion-cop-nmlz-cop.plt-though  

      `Talking about the emotion of seeing Everest,'
 . um, Himalaya Mountains have a very unique shape I've never seen before,
 . Actually, local people call them holy mountains,
 . hm, somehow their shapes are sacred.
     S01F0151: 460.73-477.82




Readers might speculate that
these elements appear in phrasal IUs because they are long expressions.
However, examples of the experimental study in Int:IUISUnitExp that force the speakers to assume topics to be unused,
are short expressions (one word).
The experiment show that
these short unused topics are still produced in phrasal IUs.



Strongly evoked elements in clausal IUsInt:Cor:Topic:CIU

I propose that strongly evoked elements, usually pronouns coded by topic markers, are uttered in clausal IUs,
although they are categorized into phrasal IUs by the current definition.
Because strongly evoked elements tend to be uttered in low pitch with smaller pitch range than the following accentual phrase,
they are likely to be counted as phrasal IUs.
However, I argue that they should be regarded as clausal IUs.
The number of pronouns are very small, which does not influence the overall tendency in Figure IUParF and Table IUParT and
hence this change does not affect the conclusion proposed in the last section.
The claim that pronouns are strongly evoked elements
is supported in
Figure DistExpTypeF3,
repeated from Figure DistExpTypeF2,
which shows the time difference between
when the first mora of the element in question is produced and
when that of its antecedent is produced.


This is assumed to approximate the activation cost of elements.
As indicated in the figure,
pronouns have as low activation costs as zero pronouns.

First, I show examples of strongly evoked elements and their pitch contours.
The pitch contours are different from evoked elements we have seen
in the previous section.
is one of the few examples from the corpus of the current study, CSJ,
whose pitch contour is shown in Figure S00F0014_soreF.
The IU boundary ``is inserted based on the current definition.
I argue that there is no boundary after sore-wa `that-wa'.

.S00F0014_soresore-wa  nan-daroo-to omot-te  

		that-wa  what-cop.infr-quot think-and  

		`(I) was wondering what it was...'
		S00F0014: 654.06-655.18


Since the number of pronouns is small in the current corpus,
I provide examples from another corpus.
Examples and are from
the Chiba three-party conversation corpus,
which is a corpus of three people's casual conversation Den_2007_SAC.
Their pitch contours are shown in Figures chiba0232_areF and chiba1232_soreF respectively.
Again, the IU boundary is inserted based on the current definition
that I challenge.

.chiba0232_areare  kir-en-no-ka-na  

		that  cut-cap-nmlz-q-q  

		`Can (you) cut it?'
		chiba0232: 442.56-443.33

. chiba1232_soresore  dame-zyan  

		that  wrong-fp  

		`It's wrong, isn't it?'
		chiba1232: 155.92-156.64





As shown in Figure S00F0014_soreF-chiba1232_soreF,
there is neither a pause nor vowel lengthening,
which is often observed IU-finally.
Moreover, the accent nucleus is not clearly observed in these pronouns.
This suggests that
a phrasal IU of evoked elements coded by topic markers and
that of strongly evoked elements are qualitatively different.
Since strongly evoked elements are already evoked and do not need to attract the hearer's attention,
they are uttered with lower pitch.
When they are followed by the predicate, which is typically not evoked and needs to attract the hearer's attention,
the predicate is uttered with higher pitch,
which causes a pitch reset.



























I challenge the claim that this type of strongly evoked element actually forms a single chunk of processing.
First,
in addition to the qualitative difference between phrasal IUs of evoked elements and of strongly evoked elements,
the transition from the IU with a single strongly evoked element such as are and sore in Figure S00F0014_soreF-chiba1232_soreF to the next is too fast for the speaker to plan the next utterance,
assuming that an IU represents some kind of processing unit.
This suggests that the current element and the following element(s) belong to a single processing unit.

Second, a single strongly evoked element is too small a number for a processing unit.
Pronouns in particular are of relatively high frequency (although they are less frequent than zero pronouns) and the referent is assumed to have been evoked both in the speaker's and the hearer's mind.
Although ``the magic number'' is still controversial (including the skepticism about ``expressing capacity limits of human cognition in terms of a number'' [][p. 245]oberauer07),
cowan00,cowan05 estimates that the magic number is around four in healthy young adults,
whereas, in the original proposal in miller56,
the number is seven plus or minus two.
Anyway, one element is too small in terms of this magic number.






Third,
it is known that, historically, unstressed pronouns can change into clitics, then into affixes givon76.
Japanese pronouns such as are and sore are not exceptions;
r in are and sore are sometimes reduced and are uttered very quickly,
which is highly likely to become a motivation for them to change into clitics in the future.
Moreover, these pronouns often do not seem to have a clear pitch peak any more.
The original pitch accent of kore, sore, and are is LH
(The accent type of kore, sore, and are is a flat type;
i.e., they do not have accent nucleus).
However, at least the pitch contours of the pronouns in Figure S00F0014_soreF-chiba1232_soreF are not LH any more.
	 
	This breaks one of the pitch accent principles of Japanese discussed in BackSubSecGeneralChar,
	which states that the pitches of the first and the second morae within a word must be different.
	I claim that this is one of the motivations for pronouns to appear after the predicate.
	See also WO:PostP:Motivations:IU for discussion.
	
The pronoun are in Figure chiba0232_areF is completely low,
and sore-wa in Figure S00F0014_soreF is HL, whose first pitch I believe is high because the pronoun appear utterance-initially.
When such clitic pronouns start to phonologically depend on other words,
it becomes harder to argue that a single clitic corresponds to a single processing unit.

From the observations above,
I propose that IUs with a single anaphoric element do not form a single processing unit;
rather, it is more appropriate to integrate it to the following IU and regard the whole chunk as a unit of processing.
How to decide to integrate some IUs into the following IUs but not others is necessary to investigate in the future research.

I have claimed that
evoked topics tend to be uttered in phrasal IUs,
while strongly evoked topics tend to be uttered in clausal IUs.
This section discusses cases where
lexical NPs coded by topic markers are produced in clausal IUs
for several reasons.

First, contrasted elements coded by topic markers are typically uttered in a clausal IU;
the pitch range of contrasted elements with the topic marker wa is larger than
that of the predicate.
In , for example,
where the speaker is talking about his life with his dog in Germany,
ti-nomi-go `infant' and inu `dog' are contrasted.

.S02M1698_tinomigo
 . ti-nomi-go-wa hair-e-nai-yoona resutoran-mo  

 		milk-drink-child-wa enter-cap-neg-like restaurant-also  

		`Restaurants where infants are not allowed to enter,'
 . inu-wa hair-eru-to  

 		dog-wa enter-cap-quot 

 		`dogs are allowed to enter.'
		S02M1698: 252.32-256.10


As shown in Figures S02M1698_tinomigoF and S02M1698_inuF,
the pitch range of the contrasted elements coded by the topic marker wa are larger than that of the predicates.

In a similar vein,
in ,
siken `exam' is implicitly contrasted with mensetsu `interview'.
Although the speaker did not do well in the exam,
she had a fun time in the interview and she successfully passed the admission.
.S01F0038_siken
 . tabun siken-wa dame-dat-ta-n-desu-ga  

 	probably exam-wa bad-cop-past-nmlz-plt-though  

	`Probably (the result of) the exam was bad, but'
 . (I) successfully passed the admission.
 S01F0038: 257.69-261.75



In this case,
as shown in Figure S01F0038_sikenF,
siken `exam' is uttered in a wider pitch range than the predicate.

Also,
when the clause is in a special status and is uttered faster,
elements coded by topic markers are typically uttered in clausal IUs.
For example, inserted clauses are uttered faster relative to other utterances and their pitch is lower than the surrounding utterances.
In , where the speaker explains Everest treks and which course she took,
she inserts the clause describing the geometry of the Himalayas in [c].
This clause contains an element coded by a topic marker, i.e., himaraya-wa `Himalaya-wa',
which is uttered in a clausal IU.

	`The course I took for trekking is called the Everest Trail, which exactly, uh the Himalayas are long horisontally, uh on the east side is Everest and we walked toward Everest.'
	S01F0151: 89.71-105.25


As shown in Figure S01F0151_himarayaF,
the F peak of himaraya-wa `Himalaya-wa' is higher than
that of the following predicate;
therefore there is no IU boundary between the noun and the predicate.
	 
	In S01F0151_himaraya, pitch range difference cannot be used
	to determine the IU boundary
	because the F of the phrase himaraya-wa is always high
	and hence one cannot meaningfully measure the pitch range.
	In this case, the IU boundary is identified after the phrase in question
	if the F peak of the phrase is lower than that of the following phrase.
	In S01F0151_himaraya, the F peak of himaraya-wa is higher than that of the predicate.
	Therefore, the IU boundary is not identified after the phrase himaraya-wa
	[see][p. 420 ff.]igarashietal06.
	
In a similar way,
in , where the speaker talks about her childhood dream,
she comments on her dream in the inserted clause [a].

.S01F0038_ohanayasan
 . maa kore-wa tukinami-desu-ga  

 		fl this-wa ordinary-cop.plt-though  

		`This (dream) might be too ordinary, but'
 . because I liked beautiful flowers,
 . (my dream was) florist.
  S01F0038: 53.90-58.93


Figure S01F0038_ohanayasanF shows the pitch contour of [a].
As in the figure,
the F peak of the topic phrase kore-wa `this-wa' is higher than that of the predicate.
Therefore, there is no IU boundary after kore-wa.

Another type of topic-coded element uttered in an clausal IU is
embedded in a noun-modifier clause or quotation clause.
For example, in [a],
piano-wa `piano-wa' is embedded in a quotation clause;
the clause is the content of what the speaker thought.

.S00F0209_piano
 . aa moo  kore-wa totemo piano-wa yat-te-rare-nai-na-to omot-tara  

 	oh any.more  this-wa ever piano-wa do-prog-cap-neg-fp-quot think-cond  

	`When I thought that (I) cannot play piano any more,'
 . it was so painful that I could not stand.
  S00F0209: 214.53-219.84


As indicated in Figure S00F0209_pianoF,
which shows the pitch contour of [a],
the F peak of the topic phrase piano-wa is higher than that of the predicate and the whole clause is interpreted as a single IU.

Table IUParT and Figure IUParF,
repeated here as Table IUParT2 and Figure IUParF2,
indicates that ga- and o-coded elements are more likely to
appear in clausal IUs than those coded by topic markers.
In terms of grammatical function,
it turned out that especially Ss are more likely to be uttered in
clausal IUs than As,
as shown in Table IUASPT and Figure IUASPF,
which show the distribution of grammatical function in terms of intonation unit regardless of whether elements are coded by topic markers or case markers.
Since ga and o codes focus and
S and P also correlate with focus,
it is reasonable to conclude that
focus in general tends to appear in clausal IUs.

[b] is an example of S in clausal IUs.
The element o-hanasi-ga `plt-speech-ga'
is uttered in a clausal IU.

.S00M0221_ohanashi

 		`somebody proposed that employees should improve the method.'
	S00M0221: 503.23-511.02


As shown in Figure S00M0221_ohanashiF,
there is no pitch reset in the first mora of the predicate.
Also,
the pitch range of o-hanasi-ga `plt-speech-ga' is larger
than that of the predicate de-masi-te `come.out-plt-and',
which indicates that the S element and the predicate are uttered in a single IU.

In a similar vein, in ,
whose pitch contour is shown in Figure S05M1236_shikitariF,
the S element sikitari-ga `tradition-ga' and the predicate
are uttered in a single IU;
there is no pitch reset observed in the first mora of the predicate.

.S05M1236_shikitarihizyooni kanasii  anoo  sikitari-ga ari-masi-te

 . (I) started to think like this.
  S01M0182: 251.43-257.40


As shown in Figure S01M0182_licenseF,
since there is no pitch reset at the first mora of the predicate tori-tai `take-want' and the pitch range of the element puro-raisensu-o `professional-license-o' is larger than that of the predicate,
there is no IU boundary after the element puro-raisensu-o `professional-license-o'.

Similarly, in [c],
whose pitch contour is shown in Figure S02F0100_shujutsuF,
the clause is uttered in a single IU.

Here, I discuss ga-coded S and o-coded P that
appear in phrasal IUs.
Although they are more likely to be uttered in clausal IUs than 
those coded by topic markers,
there are many of those uttered in phrasal IUs
as shown in Table IUASPT and Figure IUASPF.
I point out two types of focal elements uttered in phrasal IUs.

The first type of this kind is strongly evoked elements
which are uttered in lower pitch than their predicate and
therefore have an IU boundary after these elements.
They are uttered in phrasal IUs for the same reason as pronouns as discussed in Int:Cor:Topic:CIU.
For example, in , whose pitch contour is shown in Figure S00F0209_piano2F,
piano is strongly evoked and is uttered in lower pitch than its predicate.
Therefore, the F range of piano is smaller than that of the following predicate and there is an IU boundary between the element piano and the predicate.
Piano is considered to be strongly evoked
because the speaker mentions it repeatedly throughout her talk.

.S00F0209_piano2
 . zibun-yori piano-ga  umai hito-ga yononaka-ni-wa takusan  

          self-than piano-ga  good.at person-ga world-dat-wa a.lot  

 . takusan iru... 

      many exist... 

      `There are so many people who are better at (playing) piano than me...'
 .[] S00F0209: 204.28-206.81

Similarly, in [a], whose pitch contour is shown in Figure S02F0100_kusuri_piuF,
kusuri `medicine' is strongly evoked and uttered in lower pitch than the predicate tamesu `try'.
Kusuri `medicine' is strongly evoked because
it also has been mentioned immediately before [a],
as indicated by sono `that'.

.S02F0100_kusuri
 . sono s kusuri-o  tamesi-masi-ta  

       that frg medicine-o  try-plt-past  

       `(I) tried that medicine (because I was told that there was no other way).'
  . de  tasikani sono kusuri-o nuru-to  

       then  certainly that medicine-o put-cond  

       `As the doctor said, when (I) put on the medicine,'
  . (my disease) becomes a little bit better...
  S02F0100: 155.34-159.32



However, in [b], which immediately follows [a],
the F peak of kusuri `medicine' is higher than that of the predicate nuru `put on',
as shown in Figure S02F0100_kusuri_ciuF.
This contrasts with what I have claimed so far.
I believe that the F peak of kusuri in [b] is higher than that of the predicate because this appears sentence-initially.
Japanese is a clause-chaining language,
which combines multiple clauses to form a thematic unit longacre85,martin92,givon01.
F of sentence-initial clauses are the highest and it declines as the sentence goes on koisoishimoto12,ishimotokoiso12,ishimotokoiso13.
Therefore,
the elements in the sentence-initial position are the highest among other elements.
As I have argued in Int:Cor:Topic:CIU,
a pair of strongly evoked element and the following phrase should be considered to form a single processing unit.
As in Figure S00F0209_piano2F - S02F0100_kusuri_ciuF,
there is no pause or vowel lengthening between the anaphoric element and the predicate,
which typically appear IU-finally.
This supports the notion that they should be integrated into a single unit at the level higher than intonation unit.


The second type is not as clear as the first one.
I am not sure whether examples of the second type share the same characteristics.
Rather, it is likely that they are still heterogeneous.
Here I try to capture some characteristics they have.
In some examples of the second type,
the element is non-anaphoric and the F is high,
however, the F of the predicate is also high for some reason.
Examples of this kind are shown in and .
In , kusa `grass' is non-anaphoric and is uttered with prominence,
but there is a pitch reset before the predicate, which has its own F peak as in Figure S00F0014_kusaF.

.S00F0014_kusa
 . kusa-ga  hae-te ki-ta  tokoro-ni  

 		grass-ga  grow-and come-past  place-dat  

		`The place where grasses grow up'
 . some people build houses...
  S00F0014: 276.80-279.30


In ,
in a similar vein,
there is a pitch reset before the predicate;
the non-anaphoric element tatoe `metaphor' and the predicate warui `bad' have their own F peak as in Figure S00M0199_tatoeF.

.S00M0199_tatoe
 . ee tyotto  tatoe-ga  warui-n-desu-ga  

 		fl a.bit  metaphor-ga  bad-nmlz-cop.plt-though  

		`This might be a bit bad metaphor, but'
 . it's kind of kamikaze-like idea.

In other examples of the second type,
non-anaphoric elements are uttered in low pitch without prominence
as though they are strongly evoked.
In example ,
the brand-new element nyuukinbi `the deadline of repayment' is produced in low pitch against our prediction
as shown in Figure S00M0221_nyuukimbiF.

.S00M0221_nyuukimbi
 . ``Do you forget (about the deadline)?''
 . oo  nyuukinbi-ga  sugi-te ori-masu-toiu koto-de  

      fl  deadline-ga  pass-and prog.plt-plt-quot thing-cop 

      ```The deadline of repayment has passed'' something like that...'
  .[] S00M0221: 220.24-225.28


In this case, however,
nyuukinbi `the deadline of repayment' can be also regarded to be inferable through the previous context,
because the speaker has been talking about the people who did not return money,
although the speaker has not specifically mentioned nyuukinbi `the deadline'.
However, it is more natural for inferable elements
to acquire their own pitch peak.





Moreover,
there are also cases where perfectly brand-new elements are uttered in low pitch as if they were strongly evoked.
In ,
neither the element kyoomi `interest' nor the related concepts have been mentioned in the previous discourse,
while it is still uttered in low pitch as in Figure S00F0014_kyoomiF.

.S00F0014_kyoomi
 . ee sono ritoo-no  hoo-ni kyoomi-o  moti hazime-masi-te  

      fl fl neighbour.island-gen  direction-to interest-o  have start-plt-and  

      `(We) started to be interested in neighbour islands (in Hawaii),'
 . and the first island in Hawaii we went to is Maui.
 S00F0014: 149.92-156.93



I do not have a clear explanation for why this happens.
Intuitively, the F peak can be either on the element kyoomi `interest' or on the predicate moti `have'
and the nuance does not change.
However, it is unnatural if both the element and the predicate have their own F peaks.
Typically there is no pause or vowel lengthening between the element and the predicate in this type of example.
Therefore, I tentatively conclude that uttering both the element and the predicate in a coherent pitch contour is important and I leave open the question of which one should have the F peak.
I am inclined to think that the element and the predicate form a single processing unit.

This section argued that
evoked, inferable, and declining topics tend to be produced in phrasal IUs,
separately from the IU with the predicate; and
strongly evoked topics are typically produced in clausal IUs
together with the IU with the predicate;
whereas foci tend to be produced in clausal IUs,
although there are explainable exceptions.

However, as discussed in Chapter WordOrder,
topics tend to appear clause-initially and foci tend to appear right before the predicate.
An element is more likely to be uttered in clausal IUs
if it is closer to the predicate,
which implies that
foci are more likely to be uttered in clausal IUs.
Therefore, it is not entirely clear whether information structure really
affects the difference between phrasal and clausal IUs independent of word order.
As an example, let us assume that is a possible utterance that the speaker bears in his/her mind.
``()'' indicates a potential IU boundary.
For simplicity,
let us assume that
only one out of the three potential IU boundaries realizes in this utterance.

. A () B () C () Predicate

If the speaker wants to put an IU boundary in ,
the IU which includes A is a phrasal IU,
whereas the IU which includes B and C is a clausal IU
as schematized in .

. A  B C Predicate

On the other hand, if the speaker wants to put the IU boundary in ,
now the IU which includes A and B is a phrasal IU,
whereas the IU which includes C is a clausal IU.
This is schematized in .

. A B  C Predicate

This indicate that even though the speaker does not want to put the IU boundary in ,
A are uttered in a phrasal IU because of  and ;
A is more likely to be uttered in a phrasal IU than B and C because it is uttered earlier.
Similarly, B is more likely to be uttered in a phrasal IU than C.
The effects of word order should not be ignored in the distinction between phrasal and clausal IUs.
In fact,
as Figure IUWOF shows,
earlier elements are more likely to be produced in phrasal IUs
than later elements.

In the next section,
I discuss an experiment, controlling word order,
and show that topics tend to be followed by an IU boundary,
while foci are not.








[IU and IS unit: experimental study]Intonation unit and unit of information structure: experimental studyInt:IUISUnitExp

In the previous sections,
I investigated the corpus of spoken Japanese.

In this section,
I will show that my argument so far is also supported by a production experiment keeping word order constant.



MethodInt:IUISUnitExp:Meth

This section gives an overview of the method of the experiment.
First, I explain how stimuli are made (Int:IUISUnitExp:Meth:Sti),
then go over the procedure of the experiment (Int:IUISUnitExp:Meth:Proc).
Finally,
I explain how the recordings acquired are annotated (Int:IUISUnitExp:Meth:Anot).


StimuliInt:IUISUnitExp:Meth:Sti

First, I made a list of three-mora nouns without accent nucleus (the pitch formation is expected to be LHH).
I chose basic words that are used in everyday life,
such as sakura `cherry blossom' and koinu `puppy'.
I used an electronic dictionary of Japanese called UniDic
to search words
denetal02,denetal07.
	 http://sourceforge.jp/projects/unidic/
I chose words of this accent type to
exclude the potential effect of the accent of these words on the following words.
Second, I collected a list of verbs starting with low pitch.
The second mora of the verbs should be high because the first and the second morae of a word should be distinct as discussed in BackSubSecGeneralChar.
I chose these words to see the F difference between the first
and the second morae.
Third, I made 14 pairs of a noun and a verb of high collocation using Case Frame kawaharakurohashi06b,kawaharakurohashi06.
	 http://reed.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cf-search/
7 pairs are subject-verb, and
the remaining 7 pairs are object-verb,
using the same noun.

The stimuli can be schematized as in ,
where N indicates noun and V indicates verb.

. [LHH] [LH...]

Finally, I made two contexts for each pair;
in one context, the noun is interpreted as topic,
and in the other context, the noun and the verb as a whole are interpreted as focus.

Examples of two kinds of contexts and noun-verb pairs are shown in and .
The target sentence is koinu yuzut-ta `(I/we) gave (a/the) puppy'.
In , where the noun is intended to be interpreted as topic and the verb to be focus,
the referent of the noun koinu `puppy' has already been shared between the speaker and the hearer.
Only the verb yuzu-ta `gave' is news to the hearer.
In all examples,
the context forces the speakers to assume topics to be unused.

.koinut
Predicate-focus context: Yesterday the speaker and his/her friend found an abandoned puppy on the street. The speaker brought it to his/her home. Today, the speaker tells the friend what happened to the puppy.
.[] sooieba [koinu] [yuzut-ta]-yo 

by.the.way puppy give-past-fp 

`By the way, (I) gave the puppy (to somebody).'


In , on the other hand,
where both the noun and the verb are intended to be interpreted as focus,
the referent of the noun koinu `puppy' has not been shared.
Not only the verb `gave', but also `a puppy' is brand-new to the hearer.

.koinuf
 All-focus context: The speaker and his/her friend are working in an animal shelter. The friend was absent yesterday and wants to know what happened yesterday.
.[] kinoo-wa [koinu yuzut-ta]-yo 

yesterday-wa puppy give-past-fp 

`Yesterday (we) gave puppies.'








After I made stimuli,
I randomized the order of them so that
the same target sentences (with predicate-focus and all-focus contexts)
do not appear adjacent with each other.


Experimental procedureInt:IUISUnitExp:Meth:Proc

I asked seven native speakers of standard Japanese
to read aloud the stimuli.
All of the participants grew up in Tokyo or near Tokyo (such as Saitama), where standard Japanese is spoken.
All of them have lived for more than a year outside of the areas where standard Japanese is not spoken.
Four of the participants are male, and three are female.
I recorded their production using EDIROL (R09-HR) and the internal microphone.


Coding processInt:IUISUnitExp:Meth:Anot

After the recording, I coded their speech using Praat.
 http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/
First, I divided each target sentence into morae,
then I divided each mora into a consonant (if any) and a vowel.
Second, I measured F of the midpoint of the vowels with a Praat script.



Results

Figure Int:fig:Sp1-Int:fig:Sp4 show
the F of vowels of each target sentence based on information structure.
The graphs of Speaker 5--7 are omitted.
In the x-axis, n1 indicates the first mora of the noun, n2 indicates the second mora, and
v1 indicates the first mora of the verb, and so on.

In some cases, there are less than 14 data points.
This is because some vowels are devoiced.
In standard Japanese, high vowels are often devoiced between two voiceless consonants such as kusuri [k*WsWRi] `medicine'.
However, this is not always the case.
Therefore, the numbers of data points vary depending on the speaker.

The red lines indicate the plot of the predicate-focus context,
while the blue lines indicate the plot of the all-focus context.
The error bars indicate the standard variations of F.
Although the error bars are too large,
it is clear that there is a pitch reset in v1, i.e., the first mora of the verb,
and the pitch rises again in v2, i.e., the second mora of the verb.

A logistic regression analysis supports this impression.
Table Pitchv1n3GlmT and Pitchv2v1GlmT show the results of the regression analysis.
The dependent value is the F difference between the adjacent morae of each utterance;
in Table Pitchv1n3GlmT, the dependent value is the F difference between n3 and v1,
while, in Table Pitchv2v1GlmT,
it is the difference between v1 and v2.
The independent values (predictors) are information structure (the distinction between the predicate- vs. all-focus contexts),
grammatical relation (the distinction between the subject and the object),
in addition to speakers and items as random effects.

Table Pitchv1n3GlmT shows that
the predicate-focus context significantly contributes to
the F difference between n3 and v1.
The fact that the estimate is minus indicates that the F value of v1 is lower than that of n3,
which leads to the conclusion that there is a pitch reset in v1.
Table Pitchv2v1GlmT shows that, on the other hand,
both the predicate-focus structure as well as the subject significantly contribute to the F difference between v1 and v2.
The estimate is plus this time,
which indicates that there is a pitch rising from v1 to v2.
	 I do not have an explanation why the subject also contributes to the pitch difference of verbs.
	Further investigation is definitely necessary.
To summarize,
there is a pitch reset in the first mora of the verb in the predicate-focus context, where the noun is topic,
while the pitch reset is not observed in the all-focus context.

Examples of the pitch contours of actual production are shown
in Figure Int:Fig:koinut and Int:Fig:koinuf.
In Figure Int:Fig:koinut,
where one of the participants of the experiment uttered koinut,
there is a pitch reset in the first mora of the verb yuzut-ta `gave',
while in Figure Int:Fig:koinuf,
where the same participant uttered koinuf,
there is no pitch reset.

I also measured the vowel length of the last mora of the nouns.
However, neither information structure nor grammatical relation significantly contributes to the vowel length.
In addition, I conducted the regression analysis
using the pitch-range difference between the noun and the verb as a dependent variable.
Again, however,
neither information structure nor grammatical relation significantly contribute to the pitch-range difference.










































































Summary of experimental study

In this section,
I discussed the results of the production experiment
and concluded that
topic elements are produced intonationally separated from the focus predicate,
namely, in phrasal IUs;
while elements which consist of focus with the predicate are produced intonationally unified with the predicate,
namely, in clausal IUs.




DiscussionInt:Disc

This section discusses motivations for intonation units.


Principles of intonation unit, information structure, and activation cost

I propose two closely related motivations for evoked, inferable, declining, and unused topics in phrasal IUs and for foci in clausal IUs.
First,
uttering an evoked, inferable, declining, or unused topic, typically a noun followed by a topic particle, in an IU and
a focus, typically the predicate and optionally a noun, in another IU
is iconic and easy to process for both the speaker and the hearer.
I call it the iconic principle of intonation unit and information structure .

.IUIconicPThe iconic principle of intonation unit and information structure:
	In spoken language,
	an IU tends to correspond to a unit of information structure.

This motivates the tendency that
an evoked topic tends to be uttered in a phrasal IU and
a focus uttered in a clausal IU.

Second,
strongly evoked elements are proposed to be produced in a coherent IU with the predicate,
namely, in a clausal IU;
elements with low activation cost are not produced by themselves.
Based on this observation,
I propose the principle of IU and activation cost.

.IUActCostPThe principle of intonation unit and activation cost:
     all substantive IUs have similar activation costs;
     there are few IUs with only a strongly evoked element or
     those with too much new elements.

This is inspired by, but also elaborates, ``one new idea at a time'' constraint in chafe87,chafe94.
chafe87,chafe94, and matsumoto03, who follows Chafe,
considers this ``one idea'' corresponds to a grammatical category such as subject, object, and verb.
[p. 110 ff.]chafe94, for example, discusses IUs consisting of an object and a verb as exceptional IUs.
He argues that,
in such IUs,
there are special reasons for an object and a verb to be produced in an IU;
verbs have been already evoked,
the IU includes a low-content verb (such as ``have, get, give, do, make, take, use and say'', p. 111), or
the object and verb is a lexicalized phrase (such as wash dishes).
However, in my corpus,
IUs with an object and a verb (or a subject and a verb) which do not apply
to these conditions are not rare.
For example,
toti-o uba-u `deprive (somebody) of land'
is produced in a single IU.
However, the expression is not frequently used in everyday life
and the predicate uba-u `deprive' is mentioned for the first time in this monologue.
The verb uba-u `deprive' is not low-content, either.

. wareware-no  toti-o ubat-te  

      1pl-gen  land-o deprive-and  

      `(They) deprived our land...'
      S00M0199: 473.79-475.65


Similarly, in [b],
i-nai kata-ga nana-wari `those who are absent consist of 70'
is neither conventionalized nor evoked,
but it is still produced in a single IU.

.



 . Those who do not pay back their debt consist of 30 .
 . sorekara  i-nai kata-ga nana-wari-to  

      then  exist-neg person-ga seven-ratio-quot  

      `And, those who are absent consist of 70.'
 .[] S00M0221: 348.22-356.07



I argue that the NP and the verb are produced in a clausal IU
because they consist of a unit of information structure: focus.
At the same time, they form a syntactic constituent: VP.
A unit of focus can contain several clauses through clause-chaining,
but they are usually not realized as a single IU, but as several IUs
because of the limitation of processing,
which is captured by the principle IUActCostP.

The principles IUIconicP and IUActCostP compete with each other and form an actual IU.




Principle of the separation of reference and role
























































I argue that intonation units play an important role in clause-chaining.





As discussed in Chapter WordOrder,
uttering persistent elements clause-initially (with topic markers) is especially useful in clause-chaining languages;
this announces which element becomes zero in the following utterance.
This type of clause-initial elements are often uttered in phrasal IUs rather than clausal IUs.
For example, in ,
eberesto-kaidoo `Everest trail' appears clause-initially,
followed by an IU boundary,
and is mentioned three times in the following clauses as indicated by O.
  
 O is assumed to appear right before the predicate for the purpose of presentation.
 However, this assumption does not affect the analysis here.
 
This big chunk of clauses in as a whole consists of a sentence and
each clause is combined through clause-chaining.

.
. kono eberesuto-kaidoo-toiuno-wa  

	this Everest-trail-quot-wa  

	`This Everest Trail is'
. tibetto-to nepaaru-no  kooeki-ro-ni-mo nat-te ori-masi-te 

	Tibet-com Nepal-gen  trade-road-dat-also become-and prog-plt-and 

	`also used for trading  between Tibet and Nepal.'
. ma zissai-wa nihon-de iu-to  

	fl actual-wa Japan-loc say-cond  

	`Say, in Japan for example,'
. O takao-san-mitaina  yama-miti-nan-desu-keredomo  

	O Takao-mountain-like  mountain-road-nmlz-cop.plt-though  

	`it's like a road in Mt. Takao or something.'
. genti-no hitobito-nitotte-wa  ee  O tuusyoo-ro-to  iu-yoona 

	local-gen personpl-for-wa  fl  O trade-road-quot  say-like 

. insyoo-no O miti-desi-ta  

	 impression-gen O road-cop.plt-past  

 `it was a road like trading road for local people.'
 .[] (S01F0151: 105.73-120.14)






To schematize,
utterances like are frequently observed.

.
 . Topic 
 . Clause1 
 . Clause2 
 . Clause3 
 . ...

First, the topic is uttered clause-initially (often coded by topic markers) in a phrasal IU.
Then the explanation about the topic follows the topic.
In other words, expressions like [a] followed by an IU boundary establishes topics to be mentioned in the following discourse.

This type of example is small in number per monologue because there is only a few topics introduced in each monologue.
This blurs the pattern like in simple count of raw numbers like the one shown in Table IUPerT and Figure IUPerF.

































































I argue that the tendency schematized in is a realization
of the principle of the separation of reference and role proposed by
lambrecht94.
[184-185]lambrecht94 argues:
``[t]he non-canonical configurations thus allow speakers to separate the referring function of noun phrases from the relational role their denotata play as arguments in a proposition. [...]
I will call the grammatical principle whereby the lexical representation of a topic referent takes place separately from the designation of the referent's role as an argument in a proposition the principle of the separation of reference and role (PSRR) for topic expressions. The communicative motivation of this principle can be captured in the form of a simple pragmatic maxim:
`Do not introduce a referent and talk about it in the same clause'''.
In Japanese,
PSRR is reflected by the fact that
topic elements are also separated intonationally from the clause.




Summary


Summary of this chapter


This chapter analyzed intonation units in Japanese
in terms of whether an NP is intonationally separated from the predicate or not.
It argued that evoked, inferable, declining, and unused topics tend to be separated intonationally from the predicate,
while strongly evoked topics tend to be integrated into the predicate.
On the other hand,
focus elements tend to be integrated into the predicate
to form a unit of focus with the predicate.
I proposed three inter-related principles at work to determine
intonation units in Japanese.




Remaining issues

In this chapter,
I proposed to modify the definitions of intonation units.
Further studies are needed to investigate cognitively-valid definitions of intonation units.
Furthermore, it is also necessary to come up with methodology to find a unit of processing independent of intonation
to avoid circularity.

Overall,
I showed that correlated but distinct features affect the choice of particles, word order, and intonation in spoken Japanese.
The features proposed are summarized in ISFeatures in Chapter Framework,
which is repeated here as for convenience.

In Chapter Particles,
I concentrated on particles.
Topic markers such as toiuno-wa, wa, and kedo/ga
are sensitive to the assumed statuses in the given-new taxonomy of the referent in question.
All topic markers code elements that are presupposed to be
shared between the speaker and the hearer
and cannot be negated in a normal way.
Namely, topic markers are sensitive to
a and b in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures.
The marker toiuno-wa codes elements referring to an entity in evoked status in the hearer's mind.
The marker wa codes elements referring to an entity in inferable status,
in addition to elements that can be coded by toiuno-wa.
The marker kedo/ga preceded by the copula da or desu
codes elements referring to an entity that is declining or unused in the assumed hearer's mind.
Topic markers are optional except for contrastive topics.
In a formal speech style,
topic markers tend to appear.
In addition to whether the referent in question is evoked or not,
I also showed that the topic markers are partially sensitive to grammatical function (f in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures);
when the clause has two evoked arguments, A and P,
A is more likely to be coded by topic markers (in this case, wa),
rather than P.

Case markers are, on the other hand, sensitive to whether the referent is (part of) an assertion or not (a in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures),
in addition to grammatical functions (f in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures).
A, agent S, and optionally patient S are coded by ga,
whereas patient S and P tend to be coded by O.
A, S, and P in the argument focus or narrow focus environment are coded by explicit markers.
I (and the previous literature) also suggested the possibility that
ga and o are sensitive to animacy (e in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures).

In Chapter WordOrder,
I focused on word order.
I showed that shared elements, which correlate with topics, tend to appear clause-initially irrespective of the status of the given-new taxonomy.
Strongly evoked elements can appear post-predicatively
especially in conversation.
Post-predicate elements are sensitive to the given-new taxonomy (b in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures),
while clause-initial elements are sensitive to identifiability.

On the other hand, foci tend to appear pre-predicatively
(i.e., immediately before the predicate).
Pre-predicate elements tend to refer to non-shared entities,
in contrast with clause-initial topics.
Word order is also sensitive to grammatical function (f in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures),
as classically observed.
The referent of clause-initial elements is referred to by zero pronouns in the following discourse,
while the referent of pre-predicate elements repeatedly appears as full NPs.





In terms of word order,
I proposed that three inter-related principles, repeated here as Disc:oldnewprinciple, Disc:IScontinuityP, and Disc:PerFirstPrinciple are working to determine word order of spoken Japanese.
Principles Disc:oldnewprinciple and Disc:PerFirstPrinciple
predict that topics appear clause-initially,
while Principle Disc:IScontinuityP and the assumption that Japanese is a verb-final language predict that
the focus appears pre-predicatively.

. Disc:oldnewprincipleFrom-old-to-new principle:
 In languages in which word order is relatively free,
 the unmarked word order of constituents is old,
 predictable information first and new, unpredictable information last.
 ([][54]kuno78, [][p. 326]kuno04)

. Disc:IScontinuityPInformation-structure continuity principle:
 A unit of information structure must be continuous in a clause;
 i.e., elements which belong to the same unit are adjacent to each other.

. Disc:PerFirstPrinciplePersistent-element-first principle:
 In languages in which word order is relatively free,
 the unmarked word order of constituents is persistent element first and non-persistent element last.

Perhaps, there is no principle that predicts the order of strongly evoked elements because they are not necessary;
the hearer is assumed to be able to identify the referent
because it is strongly evoked.
They are produced for some intonational or interactional reasons
as has been discussed in WO:PostP:Motivations.

In Chapter Intonation,
I discussed intonation.
I showed that
evoked, inferable, declining, and unused topics tend to be produced in an intonation unit separately from the predicate,
while strongly evoked topics tend to be produced in an intonation unit together with the predicate.
On the other hand,
the broad focus tends to appear in an intonation unit with the predicate
to form a unit of predicate focus structure.
I proposed two principles determining intonation units in Japanese,
repeated here as Disc:IUIconicP and Disc:IUActCostP.
Principle Disc:IUIconicP predicts that
a topic appears in an intonation contour and a focus appears in another intonation contour,
whereas Principle Disc:IUActCostP predicts that
strongly evoked topics are glued to an IU of focus.

.Disc:IUIconicPIconic principle of intonation unit and information structure:
	In spoken language,
	an IU tends to correspond to a unit of information structure.

.Disc:IUActCostPPrinciple of intonation unit and activation cost:
     all substantive IUs have similar activation costs;
     there are few IUs with only a strongly evoked element or
     those with too many new elements.

To be more precise, these principles predict that
when the activation cost of a topic is high,
it is separated intonationally from the focus predicate, as in [a];
whereas when the activation cost of a topic is low,
it is produced with the focus predicate, as in [b-c].
A box corresponds to an IU.

Competing motivationsDisc:CompMotivations

As summarized above,
there is no single feature (such as topic or focus) which determines
the choice of particles, word order, and intonation;
multiple features influence a single linguistic expression.
This is not a rare phenomenon;
rather, it is frequently observed in languages and
it is a source of language change.
comrie79 called this variability ``seepage''.
As has been discussed in Par:CasePar:Ga:GaAnim,
ko in Hindi codes definite or animate direct object;
there is no single feature that determines the use of ko.
Citing poppe70, he discusses another example from Mongolian.
According to Poppe, the accusative suffix -iig only attaches to certain kinds of direct objects.
Human direct objects are always followed by the suffix as exemplified in
.

.Disc:Ex:Mongolian1
 . dorz bags-iig zalav 

	dorj teacher-do invited 

	`Dorj invited the teacher.'
 . bid nar olan xun-iig uzsen 

	we ? many people-do saw 

	`We saw many people.'
	[18]comrie79

On the other hand, non-human direct objects are optionally followed by the suffix, as in .
In this case,
definiteness plays an important role.
To complicate things,
the suffix also attaches to indefinite direct objects
when they are apart from the verb.

.Disc:Ex:Mongolian2
 . coidog zurag zurav 

	Choidog picture painted 

	`Choidog painted a picture'
 . zurag-iig Choidog zurav 

	picture-do Choidog painted 

	`Choidog painted the picture. (As for the picture, it was Choidog that painted it.)'
	[19]comrie79

The distinction between the so-called accusative marker o and the zero particles in Japanese is similar to the use (or non-use) of this suffix -iig in Mongolian.

The choice between o and the zero particles is reported to be determined by definiteness, animacy, and word order.
Definite or animate objects are more likely to be coded by o
rather than the zero particles minashima01,fry01,kurumadajaeger13,kurumadajaeger15.
Also,
according to tsutsui84,matsuda96, and fry01,
verb-adjacent objects are more likely to be zero-coded (hence less likely to be o-coded),
while non-verb-adjacent objects are more likely to be coded by o,
although the distinction is subtle.


dubois85 argues that multi-dimensionality of a linguistic expression is based on ``competing motivations''.

An example of competing motivations that Du Bois provides and is relevant to this study is
that of the distinction between ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative languages.

quote
The reason that not all languages are ergative -- i.e. that some languages choose the `option' of categorizing S with A rather than with O [P in terms of this study] -- 
is that there is another motivation which competes for the same limited good,
the structuring of the person-number-role paradigm. [...]
S and A are united by their tendency to code referents which are human,
(relatively) agentive, and maintained as topics over significant stretches of discourse (`thematic').
Thus, a discourse pressure to roughly mark topic/agent motivates nominative-accusative morphology,
while a discourse pressure to roughly mark new information motivates ergative-absolutive morphology.
These two pressures may be seen as competing to overlay a secondary function on the existing A/S/O base (though this formulation is of course somewhat oversimplified). [...]
Thus the answer to the question as to why not all languages are ergative is simply that,
while there is a strong discourse pressure which motivates an absolutive category, there is an equally strong -- possibly stronger --
discourse pressure which motivates a nominative category.
Both motivations cannot prevail in the competition for control of the linguistic substance of this paradigm.
[354--355]dubois85
quote

My study showed competing motivations that affect
choices of particles, word order, and intonation in spoken Japanese.
For example,
as has been discussed in Par:Dis:Markedness and nakagawa13m,
case particles are sensitive to focushood and thus
P and patient S are unmarked (zero-coded).
On the other hand, topic markers are sensitive to topichood and thus
A and agent S are unmarked in another dialect, Kansai Japanese.

If a single feature ``topic'' or ``focus'' determines the choice of word order and particles,
it is expected, for example, that
all clause-initial elements are coded by topic markers
because both clause-initial elements and those coded by topic markers are topics.
However, this is not the case,
as shown in WO:ClauseInit:Ident:Topic.
Although clause-initial elements tend to be coded by topic markers,
not all clause-initial elements are coded by topic markers.
This is because word order and topic coding are sensitive to different features, while both of them are sensitive to topichood and focushood; clause-initial elements are sensitive to identifiability,
whereas topic markers are sensitive to activation status of the referent in question.

The claim of this study is an elaboration of the claim made by
lithompson76 that
Japanese is a subject-prominent and topic-prominent language.
In terms of this study,
the claim is elaborated in the following way;
Japanese is sensitive to various features related to topichood and focushood such as presupposition vs. assertion (a in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures)
and the status of the given-new taxonomy (b in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures),
in addition to grammatical function (f in Dis:Ex:ISFeatures).

The theory of competing motivations and correlating features of topic and focus Dis:Ex:ISFeatures predicts that
there are other types of languages such as animacy-prominent languages and specificity-prominent languages.
As far as I am aware,
there are at least what I call animacy-prominent languages according to the literature [inter alia]dahlfraurud96,minkoff00,deswartetal07.
For example, in grammatical sentences in Mam-Maya,
the subject is as animate as, or more animate than the object minkoff00.


Another well-known example is Navajo (Athapaskan).
In Navajo, the order of S and P can be either SP or PS.
In the case of an SP order, the marker yi attaches before the verb;
in the case of a PS order, the marker bi attaches to the verb hale72,frischberg72.
This is exemplified in .
In [a],
where the subject `horse' precedes the object `mule',
the affix yi attaches to the verb.
In [b], on the other hand,
where the object precedes the subject,
bi is used.



.
 . lhii dzaaneez yi-ztalh 

      horse mule him-kicked 

      `The horse kicked the mule.' (SP)
 . dzaaneez lhii bi-ztalh 

      mule horse him-kicked 

      `The horse kicked the mule.' (PS)

 .[] [300]hale72

When the subject and the object are equally animate, as in ,
both yi- and bi- constructions can be used.
However,
when the subject is more animate than the object,
only yi-construction with the SP order is grammatical;
while when the object is more animate than the subject,
only bi- construction with the PS order is grammatical.
These languages can be called animate-prominent languages
in the sense that
animacy constrains word order or grammatical functions.










Finally, I point out that this kind of multivariate analysis
is not compatible with theories like generative grammar.
For example,
endo14, following Rizzi's cartography theory [e.g.,][]rizzi97,rizzi04,
points out that ``an information focus occurs immediate left to the verb'' (p. 170).
  
 An information focus is ``the answer to wh-questions and the target of negation'' (ibid.),
 which is the same focus discussed in this study.
 
This observation is compatible with that of kuno78.
In the following example [A],
hon `book' is a focus because it is the answer to the wh-question [Q].
The focus appears immediately before the verb kai-masi-ta `bought'.

.
 .[Q:] What did you buy?
 .[A:] watasi-wa hon-o kai-masi-ta 

          1sg-top book-acc buy-plt-past 

          `I bought a book.'
  [170--171]endo14

As we immediately notice, however,
the focus hon `book' is the object (P) of the sentence at the same time.
In the cartography framework,
it is not clear how to represent an element which is a focus and the object
at the same time.










Languages with hard constraintsDisc:HardConst

This study showed a variety of statistical tendencies of particle choice, word order, and intonation in Japanese.
Especially, in Chapter WordOrder and Intonation,
I discussed the distinction between
elements that appear close to the predicate (in terms of word order) and are glued to the predicate (in terms of intonation) and
elements that appear separately from the predicate (in terms of both word order and intonation).
In this section,
I discuss other languages that have conventionalized the statistical tendency shown in this study.
As bresnanetal01 state,
``soft constraints mirror hard constrains'';
namely, ``[t]he same categorical phenomena which are attributed to hard grammatical constraints in some languages continue to show up as statistical preferences in other languages,
motivating a grammatical model that can account for soft constraints'' (p. 29).
See also givon79,bybeehopper01.

In Disc:HardConst:Integrated,
I discuss languages that
integrate some elements into the predicate.
In Disc:HardConst:Separated,
I focus on languages that
separate some elements from the predicate.


Elements glued to the predicateDisc:HardConst:Integrated

There are two kinds of elements proposed in this study
that are glued to the predicate:
strongly evoked elements that are postposed and
focus elements.


Affixation of pronouns

First, I discuss languages where strongly evoked elements, especially pronouns, are glued to the predicate.
As discussed in WOPostPreEles,
strongly evoked elements in spoken Japanese can appear immediately after the predicate, with a single intonation contour with the predicate.
This is a statistical tendency (i.e., soft constraint) rather than a categorical phenomenon (i.e., hard constraint),
showing that strongly evoked elements tend to be glued to the predicate.
I argue that in languages with hard constraints,
this corresponds to so-called ``grammatical agreement''.
In languages with grammatical agreement,
an affix, which is coreferential with the subject or the object,
typically attaches to the verb.
As [151]givon76 states,
``[grammatical agreement and pronominalization] are fundamentally one and the same phenomenon, and [...] neither diachronically nor, most often, synchronically could one draw a demarcating line on any principled grounds.''
He argues that ``subject grammatical agreement'' arose from topic-shift constructions like [a],
which are reanalyzed as ``subject-verb agreement'', as in [b].

.Disc:HardConst:Integrated:Ex:TS
 . Topic shift
 .[] The man, he came. 

        (topic) (pronoun) (verb) 

 . Neutral (reanalyzed)
 .[] The man he-came. 

        (subject) (agreement)-(verb) 

 [155]givon76

Givon argues that
``[t]he morphological binding of the pronoun to the verb is an inevitable natural phenomenon, cliticization,
having to do with the unstressed status of pronouns, their decreased information load and the subsequent loss of resistance to phonological attrition'' (p. 155).
The following are examples from Swahili (Bantu).
In [a],
the subject m-toto `child (class 1)' has an agreement relationship with the verb prefix a `he (class 1)'.
According to Givon,
the verb prefix a originates from a pronoun.
Similarly, in [b],
the subject ki-kopo `cup (class 7)' agrees with ki `it (class 7)'.
The examples are glossed based on contini-morava94.

.
 . m-toto a-li-kuja 

      cl1-child 3sbj.cl1-past-come 

      `The child came.'






 . ki-kopo ki-li-vunjika 

      cl7-cup 3sbj.cl7-past-break 

      `The cup broke.'






 [157]givon76

Also, preposed objects are attested in Swahili,
and they have an agreement relationship with a verb affix in a way similar to subject agreement.
The object m-toto `child (class 1)' agrees with the interfix kw `him (class 1)', as in [a], and
the object ki-kopo `cup (class 7)' with ki `it (class 7)', as in [b].

.
 . m-toto, ni-li-mw-ona 

      cl1-child 1sg-past-3obj.cl1-see 

      `The child, I saw him.'
 . ki-kopo, ni-li-ki-vunja 

      cl7-cup 1sg-past-3obj.cl7-break 

      `The cup, I broke it.'
      (ibid.)
      
wals-101 states that
``[l]anguages in which pronominal subjects are expressed by pronominal affixes are widespread throughout the world.''
According to him,
in 437 out of 711 languages,
``pronominal subjects are expressed by affixes on verbs.''
Mian (Ok, Papua New Guinea) is one of those languages.
As shown in , in Mian,
the subject is expressed by the suffix i, and
the object are expressed by the prefix a.

.
 ne naka=e a-teme'-b-i=be 

 1sg man=sg.m 3sg.m.obj-see.impfv-impfv-1sg.sbj=decl 

 `I am looking at the man.'
 [261]fedden07


givon76 argues that
the subject-agreement stems from topic-shift constructions like Disc:HardConst:Integrated:Ex:TS,
while the object-agreement originates from afterthought-topic constructions like Disc:HardConst:Integrated:Ex:AT,
i.e., post-predicate constructions,
at least in SVO languages.

.Disc:HardConst:Integrated:Ex:AT
 . Topic shift
 .[] The man, I saw him.
 . Afterthought
 .[] I saw him, the man.
 . Neutral
 .[] I saw-him the man.

Deaccented pronouns in Japanese can be interpreted as premature pronominal affixes.



















Noun incorporation

While focus elements tend to be produced pre-predicatively in a coherent intonation contour with the predicate in Japanese,
I propose that, in languages with hard constraints,
focus elements are incorporated into the predicate.
In this section,
I point out some similarities between focus elements in the predicate focus environment and incorporated nouns.
Also, I discuss similarities between focus zero-coding and noun incorporation based on mithun84.
In noun incorporation,
a nominal and predicate form a unit;
nominals and the predicate are phonologically, morphologically, and syntactically cohesive.
According to mithun84,
zero-coding is the first stage of noun incorporation.











First,
as mithun84 states,
typically incorporated nouns are indefinite and/or non-specific,
which are features correlating with focus.
Definite and/or specific nouns, which are closer to topics,
are not incorporated into the verb.
Examples are shown below from Onondaga.
[11]woodbury75a states that
``[i]t is generally agreed that a noun which is incorporated makes a more general reference than one which is free of the verb stem.''
In [a], the noun `tobacco',which is not incorporated into the verb,
refers to specific tobacco, and, as the translation shows,
it is interpreted as definite.
On the other hand, in [b],
the incorporated noun `tobacco' refers to tobacco in general rather than a specific tobacco, as the translation shows.

. Onondaga (Iroquoian)
 . waP-ha-hninu-P neP oyEPkwa-P 

       tr-3sg-buy-asp the tobacco-n.s. 

       `He bought the tobacco.'
 . waP-ha-yEPkwa-hni:nu-P 

      tr-3sg-tobacco-buy-asp 

      `He bought tobacco.'
      [10]woodbury75a
































Similarly, in pseudo-noun incorporation in Niuean (Oceanic),
definite nouns cannot be incorporated into the verb.
Niuean is a VSO language;
canonically, the object appears after the subject.
On the other hand,
incorporated objects appear after the verb (before the subject),
from which one can see noun incorporation.
Unlike typical noun incorporation,
incorporated nouns can accompany modifiers,
as shown in .
This is why massam01 calls this pseudo-noun incorporation.
Note that the A argument mele is coded as absolutive instead of ergative.

. Niuean (Oceanic)
 . ne inu kofe kono a mele 

      past drink coffee bitter abs Mele 

      `Mele drank bitter coffee.'
 . ne holoholo kapiniu kiva fakaeneene a sione 

      past wash dish dirty carefully abs Sione 

      `Sione washed dirty dishes carefully.'
  [158]massam01

Niuean does not allow nouns coded by case markers or number articles
to be incorporated
because they are interpreted as definite and non-specific.

.



 . *ne inu e kofe kona a mele 

      past drink abs coffee bitter abs Mele 

      `Mele drank the bitter coffee.'
 . *kua holoholo tau kapiniu a mele 

       pfv wash pl dishes abs Mele 

       `Mele washes the dishes.'
 (op.cit.: 168)

In Southern Tiwa,
all inanimate direct objects must be incorporated,
while animate direct objects are optionally incorporated allenetal84.
As shown in the contrast between [a] and [b],
the inanimate object shut `shirt' is incorporated,
otherwise it is ungrammatical.

. Southern Tiwa (Tanoan)
 . ti-shut-pe-ban 

      1sg.A-shirt-make-past

      `I made the/a shirt.'
 . *shut ti-pe-ban 

      shirt 1sg-make-past

      [293]allenetal84

On the other hand,
animate objects are only optionally incorporated,
they are grammatical irrespective of whether they are incorporated or not,
as shown in [a-b].

.
 . ti-seuan-mu-ban 

      1sg.A-man-see-past 

      `I saw the/a man.'
 . seuanide ti-mu-ban 

      man 1sg.A-see-past 

      `I saw the/a man.'
      [294-295]allenetal84

Southern Tiwa is sensitive to animacy instead of definiteness.
However Southern Tiwa is like Onondaga and Niuean discussed above
in the sense that
Ps with features correlating with focus are incorporated,
while Ps with features correlating with topic can be not incorporated.


Second,
while patient nouns tend to be incorporated into the verb,
agent nouns are not incorporated mithun84,baker88.
In Southern Tiwa, for example,
the patient Ss, `dipper' and `snow', are incorporated, as in ,
while the agent S, `dog', cannot be incorporated, as in .
. Southern Tiwa (Tanoan)
 . i-k'uru-k'euwe-m 

	B-dipper-old-pres 

	`The dipper is old.'
 . we-fan-lur-mi 

	C.neg-snow-fall-pres.neg 

	`Snow isn't falling. (It is not snowing.)' [300]allenetal84
	
.
 . khwienide O-teurawe-we 

	dog A-run-pres 

	`The dog is running.'
 . *O-khwien-teurawe-we 

	A-dog-run-pres 

	`The dog is running.' (op.cit.: 299)

This is parallel with Onondaga, as shown by the contrast between and .
Patient S is incorporated into the verb, as in ,
while agent S cannot be incorporated, as in [b].
Glosses are based on [87-89]baker88.

. Onondaga (Iroquoian)
 . ka-hsahePt-ahi-hw-i 

	3n-bean-spill-caus-asp 

	`Beans got spilled.'
	[15]woodbury75

.
 . h-ate-Pse:-P neP o-tsiPkt-aP 

	3mS-refl-drag-asp the pre-louse-suf 

	`The louse crawls.'
 . *h-ate-tsiPkti-Pse:-P 

	3mS-refl-louse-drag-asp 

	`The louse crawls.'
	(ibid.)

[875]mithun84 argues that,
verb-internally, incorporated nouns bear a limited number of possible semantic relationships to their host verbs.
This applies no matter whether the language is basically of the ergative, accusative, or agent/patient type.
She proposes the following hierarchy of possible noun incorporations in different languages.
Agent S and A are put in parentheses because they are not attested in Mithun's data.
The hierarchy implies that
languages which incorporate patient S can also incorporate P,
but not necessarily vice versa.

. P  patient S ( agent S  A)






I point out that the same hierarchy explains the variety of zero-coding cross-linguistically.
According to mithun84,
simple juxtaposition of a noun (without any markers) and a verb is the first stage of noun incorporation.







There are many examples of languages without P-coding discussed in the literature
[inter alia]comrie79,comrie83,croft03,aissen03,haspelmath08.
In these languages,
Ps with features correlating with topic,
i.e.,  animate, human, and/or definite Ps,
are overtly coded,
while Ps with features correlating with focus
are zero-coded.
Some examples are discussed above as Disc:Ex:Mongolian1-Disc:Ex:Mongolian2 in Disc:CompMotivations.
Another example is from Russian,
which has a special marker for animate (or human) Ps,
but not for inanimate Ps.
As shown in the following examples,
nosorog `rhinoceros' in [a], an animate P,
is overtly coded by the direct object marker a,
whereas il `slime', an inanimate P,
is zero-coded.

.
 . begemont ljubit nosorog-a 

      hippopotamus loves rhinoceros-do 

      `The/a hippopotamus loves the/a rhinoceros.'
 . begemont ljubit il 

      hippopotamus loves slime 

      `The hippopotamus loves (the) slime.'

Examples for languages without P- and patient-S-codings are (Standard) Japanese and Lahu.
In (Standard) Japanese,
as discussed in Par:CasePar:Ga,
the agent S tends to be coded overtly, as in [a],
while the patient S tends to be zero-coded, as in [b-c]
[93]kageyama93.

.Disc:Ex:Kodomo
	.Disc:Ex:Kodomoaa kodomo-ga/??O ason-deru 

		oh child-nom/O play-prog 

		`Look! A child is playing.' (Agent S)






		. a saihu-ga/O oti-teru 

			oh wallet fall-prog 

			`Look! A wallet has fallen!' (Patient S)

and are examples from Lahu.
As in [a],
the definite P `the liquor' is coded with the accusative marker,
while the indefinite P `liquor' is not.
. Lahu (Tibeto-Burman)
 . j1 tha' dO 

	liquor acc drink 

	`to drink (the) liquor'
 . j1 dO 

	liquor drink 

	`to drink liquor' (P)
 .[] [p. 307]matisoff81

As in ,
the indefinite patient S is also zero-coded in Lahu (ibid.).
	. mu-ye la 

			rain comes 

			`it is raining.' (Patient S)

 
 The expression mu-ye as a whole means `rain (noun)';
 which originates from mu `sky' and ye `water'
 [60]matisoff81.
 

There are also languages which zero-code P, patient S, and agent S.
In Kansai Japanese, for example,
agent Ss can be also zero-coded in addition to Ps and patient S.











Disc:Ex:Kodomoa without ga is acceptable in Kansai Japanese [see also][]nakagawa13m.
	 
	Although the form of the sentence is identical,
	the pitch accent is drastically different and it is easy to distinguish Standard Japanese from Kansai Japanese.
	Grammaticality judgements are of mine.
	













































































































Elements separated from the predicateDisc:HardConst:Separated

As discussed in Int:IUISUnitCorp:Topic and Int:IUISUnitExp,
topics which have not been established are produced intonationally separate from the predicate.
This section explores the possibility of the existence of
languages with hard constraints,
i.e., languages that do not allow unestablished topics to appear together with the predicate or main clause.

I did not find languages which match this exact condition.
However, one of the related phenomena is that, in some languages,
indefinite non-generic NPs cannot in general be the subject;
they can only be the subject of existential constructions [173ff.]givon76.
I assume that, in these languages,
the connection between the subject (A and S) and topic is so strong
that non-topical subjects are not allowed.








Canonical pre-verbal subjects in many Bantu languages are inherently topical and
subjects cannot be focus in situ (See downinghyman16 and works cited therein for the summary of information structure in Bantu languages).
For example, in Northern Sotho,
it is possible for the subject to appear in the canonical pre-verbal position, as in [a]
or in the post-verbal position, as in [b].

.
 . Mo-nna o ngwala le-ngwalo 

      cl1-man cl1 write cl5-letter 

      `The man is writing a letter.'
 . Go fihla mo-nna 

      cl17 arrive cl1-man 

      Lit. `There arrives a man.'
     [171]zerbian06


It is ungrammatical to put wh-words in the canonical pre-verbal position, as shown in .

.
 . *Mang o nyaka ngaka? 

       who cl1 look.for cl9.doctor 

       Intended: `Who is looking of the doctor?'
 . *O nyaka ngaka mang? 

       cl1 look.for cl9.doctor who 

       Intended: `Who is looking for the doctor?'
     [69]zerbian06

In many Bantu languages,
it appears that an NP must be introduced in a special clause of non-canonical VS order and,
only after that, can the NP be mentioned in a normal clause of canonical SV(P) order to bring the narrative forward.

Also in French, which is a SV(P) language,
VS order is used to focalize the subject and the predicate typically expresses existence, emergence, and motion togoohki86.
Because the inverted subject is focus,
the scope of negation is the subject, as shown in [a], and
it is unnatural to provide alternatives incompatible with the subject, as in [b].

.
 . Dans cet immeuble n'habitent pas des ouvriers francais, mais des ouvriers espagnols. 

      in this building not.live neg some workers French but some workers Spanish 

      `In this building, French workers do not live, but Spanish workers.'
 . ??Dans cet immeuble n'habitent pas des ouvriers francais, mais dans l'autre immeuble. 

      in this building not.live neg some workers French but in the.other building 

      `In this building, French workers do not live, but in the other building.'

      [3, translated by NN]togoohki86

It is infelicitous to put more new elements after the inverted subject.
For example, [a], which is a typical subject inversion, is acceptable,
whereas [b], which is [a] followed by another phrase `by French and Japanese educators', is not acceptable.

.
 . Dans ce debat ont ete discutes problemes de l'education morale. 

      in this debate have be discuss problems of the.education moral 

      `In this debate, problems of moral education were discussed.'
 . ??Dans ce debat ont ete discutes problemes de l'education morale par des pedagogues francais et japonais. 

      in this debate have be discuss problems of the.education moral by some educators French and Japanese 

      `In this debate, problems of moral education were discussed by French and Japanese educators.'
      (op.cit.: 4)

Interestingly, however,
if a pause is inserted between the VS part (ont ete discutes problemes de l'education morale `problems of moral education were discussed') and the additional phrase (par des pedagogues francais et japonais `by French and Japanese educators') in [b],
the acceptability improves.
This suggests that a new NP is introduced in a special construction of VS order, and additional new information cannot be introduced within the same intonational phrase in French.


Summary

This section outlined a summary of the study and
discussed languages that grammaticalize the tendencies proposed in this study.
Of course the discussion provided more possibilities than conclusion.
Further investigation is needed to analyze the exact associations between languages with hard constraints and those with soft constraints.
Also, it is intriguing to account for 
the factors that determine whether a language has
hard constraints or soft constraints.














ConclusionConclusion




Summary

This study attempted to partially answer a larger question of
how Japanese speakers communicate with each other
through abduction of the mental state of other people.
It revealed that Japanese speakers employ a variety of cues to express the speaker's assumption about the hearer's mental state.

While a great amount of literature has discussed the distinction between wa and ga,
the relationships among other kinds of particles have not been discussed as thoroughly.
Chapter Particles in this study revealed the distinction between wa and other topic particles such as toiuno-wa and kedo/ga preceded by copula,
as well as the distribution of case markers,
by drawing a semantic map of particles.
It also investigated the distribution of the zero particles and their associations with information structure.

The previous literature investigated clause-initial, pre-predicate, and post-predicate constructions 

independently in different frameworks;
however, there was no unified account of word order in Japanese.
In Chapter WordOrder,
I described word order in spoken Japanese in a unified framework.

Chapter Intonation investigated intonation.
While the previous literature mainly concentrates on contrastive focus,
this study discussed both topic and focus.
I investigated intonation as a unit of processing and
argued that information structure influences the form of intonation units.

To the best of my knowledge,
particles, word order, and intonation in Japanese have been investigated separately in the literature;
there was no unified theory to account for the whole phenomena.
This study investigated the phenomena as a whole in a consistent way
by annotating the same information for all linguistic expressions and
by employing the same analytical framework.





Theoretical and methodological implications

This section discusses some theoretical and methodological implications
this study has.
First, I proposed that topic and focus are multidimensional
rather than homogeneous;
topic and focus are interpreted to be a bundle of features and
each feature is scalar rather than binary.
Different languages are sensitive to different features to different degrees.
Even within a language,
different linguistic expressions are sensitive to different features to various extents.
Moreover, it is often the case that
a single linguistic expression is sensitive to multiple features.
As outlined in Chapter Background,
different authors discuss different kinds of topic and focus,
which is a confusing situation.
I argue that linguistic research would be clearer if one asks
``what feature(s) is/are sensitive to what linguistic expression(s)?'',
instead of asking
``which feature best predicts the distribution of some linguistic expressions?''

Second,
I proposed methods of annotation and analysis
that are cross-linguistically applicable.
I did not annotate all the features proposed in ISFeatures in FrameworkDefinition;
however, all the features can be defined independent of language-specific categories and can be applied universally.
Some features such as specificity and definiteness are hard to annotate, and it is highly likely that different annotators have different intuitions about the expression in question.
I argue that this is not a problem.
In real life,
some people might interpret some expression to be definite,
while other people might interpret the same expression to be indefinite.
This is a source of linguistic variation, and there is no single right answer.
Ideally, a statistically sufficient number of annotators annotate the same corpus, and all the annotations are used in analyses.

Third,
I point out the importance of qualitative analysis in addition to quantitative analysis.
In TopPar, for example,
I concluded that toiuno-wa and wa attach to elements in different statuses in the given-new taxonomy by examining each example,
even though the difference was not visible from the raw numbers.
This is because my annotation is not fine-grained enough to capture the subtle difference between these markers.
Of course, it is necessary to run statistical tests in the future.
However, it is also important to examine each example to make sure that
the results do not contradict observations.





Remaining issues

This study has many remaining issues to be investigated in the future.
I discuss two of these in this section.



Predication or judgement types

As discussed in Chapter Background,
traditional Japanese linguistics scholars have paid attention to
predication types or judgement types.
Predication or judgement types include the distinctions between thetic vs. categorical judgements and between attribute vs. phenomenon judgements
matsushita28,yamada36,mio48,kuroda72,masuoka08,kageyama12.
Although this study focused on the distinction among nominal types such as topic and focus,
the findings of this study can be integrated into theories of predication or judgement types.
This implies that information structure is not only related to properties of NPs;
rather, it is also associated with properties of predicates.
Especially, grammatical categories such as tense, aspect, modality, and evidentiality are highly likely to related to types of information structure.
For example, as masuoka12 points out,
the topic marker toiuno-wa cannot be used in event predication (or stage-level predication);
it can only be used in property predication (or individual-level predication).
  
 See Back:GeneralChar:Toiunowa in Chapter Background
 for the distinction between property vs. event predication.
 
This is shown in the contrast between [a] and [b].
[a], where toiuno-wa is used in event predication with simple past tense,
is unacceptable.
[b],
on the other hand, where toiuno-wa is used in property predication,
is acceptable.

.
 . *sachiko-toiuno-wa uso-o tui-ta 

      Sachiko-toiuno-wa lie-o spit-past 

      `Regarding Sachiko, she lied.'
     [p. 96]masuoka12
 . sachiko-toiuno-wa uso-tuki-da 

      Sachiko-toiuno-wa lie--spitter-cop 

      `Regarding Sachiko, she is a liar.'
     (Constructed)

masuoka12 concludes that
toiuno-wa is used only for property predication.

Moreover, it is well known that
the interpretations of wa and ga change
depending on predicate types kuroda72,kuno73.
In property predication,
wa is the default marker, and
ga tends to be interpreted to be exhaustive listing.
As exemplified in [a-b], both of which are copular sentences (i.e., property predication),
the sentence with wa [a] is considered to have a common topic-comment structure,
while the sentence with ga [b] is considered to focus only John.
Specifically, [b] is interpreted as the answer to the question `who is a student?'
In Kuno's term,
ga is interpreted to be exhaustive listing.

.
 . zyon-wa gakusei-desu 

      John-wa student-cop 

      `John is a student.'
 . zyon-ga gakusei-desu 

      John-ga student-cop 

      `JOHN is a student. (it is John who is a student.)'
      [38]kuno73

In event predication,
on the other hand,
ga is the default marker and is interpreted to be a neutral description,
while wa tends to be interpreted as contrastive.
In [a-b], which involve event predication,
the NP followed by wa in [a] is interpreted to be contrastive,
while the whole sentence including the NP with ga in [b] is interpreted to have broad focus structure;
as above, in Kuno's term,
ga is considered to be neutral description.

.
 . ame-wa hut-te i-masu-ga... 

      rain-wa fall-and prog-plt-though 

      `Though it IS raining...'
 . ame-ga hut-te i-masu 

      rain-ga fall-and prog-plt 

      `It is raining.'
      (ibid.)


I am aware of only a few studies investigating the question of
why sentences of some information structure type are associated with
particular predication types.




Genres

Genres are also an important factor to influence the phenomena investigated in this study.
As pointed out in BackSubSubZero,
for example,
the choice between zero vs. overt particles is sensitive to
styles (casual vs. formal).
However, it is not clear why the formal style requires overt particles more often than
the casual style.

Also, I have argued that
post-predicate constructions are more frequent in conversations than monologues.
Although I suggested a few possible answers why this is the case (WOPostPreEles,
there is still no clear answer.
Since there is a corpus of conversations annotated in the same way as the corpus used in this study nakagawaden12,
it is useful to compare these corpora.

In monologues like the ones employed here,
it is likely that predicate-focus structure appears more frequently than in usual conversations;
the speaker usually talks about what s/he did or what happened to him/her in narratives, which fixes a topic (typically the speaker), and fixing a topic elicits a predicate-focus structure.
Moreover, because of the absence of hearers who ask wh-questions and misunderstand what the speaker means, the speaker less frequently has to answer wh-questions or correct hearers, which typically elicit an argument-focus structure.
It is important also for this reason to investigate other genres of spoken language.

AbstractAbstract
refsection

This thesis investigates the associations between information structure
and linguistic forms in spoken Japanese
mainly by analyzing spoken corpora.
It proposes multi-dimensional annotation and analysis procedures of spoken corpora and
explores the relationships between information structure
and particles, word order, and intonation.

Particles, word order, and intonation in spoken Japanese have been investigated separately in different frameworks and different subfields in the literature;
there was no unified theory to account for the whole phenomena.
This thesis investigated the phenomena as a whole in a consistent way
by annotating all target expressions according to the same criteria and
by employing the same analytical framework.
Chapter Introduction outlines the questions to be investigated and introduces the methodology of this thesis.
Chapter Background reviews the literature of Japanese linguistics
as well as the literature on information structure in different languages.
Chapter Framework proposes the analytical framework of the thesis.
Major findings are discussed in Chapter Particles, WordOrder, and Intonation.

Chapter Particles analyzes the distributions of topic and case particles.
It is made clear that so-called topic particles 
(wa, the zero particles, toiuno-wa, and kedo/ga preceded by copula) are mainly sensitive to the given-new taxonomy,
whereas case particles (ga, o, and the zero particles) are sensitive to both focushood and grammatical function.
While the distinction between wa and ga attract much attention in traditional Japanese linguistics,
the distribution of different kinds of topic and case particles, including the zero particles,
are analyzed in this thesis.

Chapter WordOrder studies word order:
i.e., clause-initial, pre-predicate, and post-predicate noun phrases.

Topical NPs appear either clause-initially or post-predicateively,
while focal NPs appear pre-predicatively.
Clause-initial and post-predicate NPs are different mainly in statuses in the given-new taxonomy.
The previous literature investigated clause-initial, pre-predicate, and post-predicate constructions in different frameworks;
however, there was no unified account for word order in Japanese.
The thesis outlines word order in spoken Japanese in a unified framework.

Chapter Intonation investigates intonation.
While the previous literature mainly concentrates on contrastive focus,
this thesis discusses in terms of both topic and focus.
It turns out that intonation corresponds to a unit of processing and
argues that information structure influences the form of intonation units.

Chapter Discussion discusses theoretical implications of these findings.
Finally, Chapter Conclusion summarizes the thesis
and points out some remaining issues and possible future studies.

Acknowledgments
refsection

This work is based on my PhD thesis,
Information Structure in Spoken Japanese: Particles, Word Order, and Intonation,
submitted in 2016 to Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University.
In 2005, I started as a graduate student of linguistics in Kyoto University, and more than 10 years have passed since then.
I cannot believe that I concentrated on a single topic for this long time,
and, on top of that,
I cannot believe that many people patiently and kindly
encouraged and helped me to finish the thesis.

First, I am most grateful to my advisor, Yuji Togo.
Since I started my graduate education,
he taught me a lot of important things,
suggested interesting issues related to my interest,
gave me precise advice, and
showed me how a scientist should be through his research and his lectures.
Without him,
I could not have even imagined finishing the thesis.
He encouraged me to do things that seemed impossible for me to achieve.

Also, I thank Yukinori Takubo and Koji Fujita,
who refereed my dissertation.
Their detailed questions and comments shed light on new issues of my thesis
from different perspectives.

In my early career in the graduate school in Kyoto University,
I met many professors and colleagues who shared interesting topics with me, advised my research, and showed their own exciting works:
Masa-Aki Yamanashi, Daisuke Yokomori, Yoshihiko Asao, Masanobu Masuda, Akihiro Yamazaki, Yukinori Kimoto, Chris Davis, Tomoko Endo, and many others who studied together.
I was very lucky to see them.
It is unfortunate that I can only name a few people here.
I thank all the people.

I learned a lot through investigating the same topic and wiring a paper with Yoshihiko Asao, Naonori Nagaya, and Daisuke Yokomori.
In particular, the works I did with Yoshihiko Asao and Naonori Nagaya,
triggered by lectures at the LSA Summer Institute 2007 at Stanford University,
influenced my research methods and research topics.
Also, I thank Yasuharu Den and his colleagues, Katsuya Takanashi, Hanae Koiso, Mika Enomoto, Kikuo Maekawa, and many others,
who inspired me and expanded my view on linguistic research.
Also, I owe a lot to Yasuharu Den, who helped to conduct statistical analysis
throughout the thesis.
Potential problems, mistakes, and misunderstanding are due to my limited knowledge of statistics.

Chapter Particles, in particular CasePar, is based on my master's thesis
submitted to State University of New York, Buffalo.
I also thank the faculty members and colleagues there.
In particular, I am grateful to Matthew Dryer,
who gave me insightful comments on my master's thesis.

Last but not least,
I am indebted to reviewers of Language Science Press,
who later revealed their identities: Yukiko Morimoto and Satoshi Imamura.
They devoted their time to giving detailed comments and questions and
helped this work to be further refined.
Furthermore, I am grateful for those who edited and corrected this book.

While I was writing my dissertation,
I was funded by Long-Term Study Abroad Program of Japan Student Services Organization,
and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (15J03835).
